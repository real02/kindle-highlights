Your story must reflect change over time. A story cannot simply be a series  of remarkable events. You must start out as one version of yourself and end  as something new. The change can be infinitesimal. It need not reflect an  improvement in yourself or your character, but change must happen.

If you had a moment that was actually storyworthy while you were on vacation, that is a  story that should be told. But it should not include the quality of the local cuisine or  anything related to the beauty or charm of the destination.

People would  rather hear the story about what happened to you last night than about what  happened to your friend Pete last night, even if Pete’s story is better than  your own. There is immediacy and grit and inherent vulnerability in hearing  the story of someone standing before you. It is visceral and real. It takes no  courage to tell Pete’s story. It requires no hard truth or authentic self.

They tell their own stories, dipping into the past somewhere in the  midst of them to show how the experiences of their parents have changed  their lives too. They share a bit of their parents’ histories, but the stories are  grounded in the storytellers’ lives. The reason these stories work so well is  that they are not history lessons or biographical sketches. They are the  stories of the people telling them. The storytellers are the protagonists, so  they are able to bring their own vulnerability, authenticity, and grit to the  tales.

Here’s why: If I tell the story about the time I died on the side of the road  and was brought back to life in the back of an ambulance, it’s going to be  challenging for an audience to connect with my story and with me. It might  be exciting and compelling and even suspenseful, but audience members  are probably not thinking, “This is just like the time I died in a car accident  and the paramedics brought me back to life!”

There’s nothing in the horror of a car accident for an audience to  connect to. Nothing that rings true in the minds of listeners. Nothing that  evokes memories of the past. Nothing that changes the way audience  members see themselves or the world around them. But if I tell you about  my secret childhood hunger, that story is much more likely to resonate with  you.

Why? We all have secrets that we hold close to our hearts. Maybe it’s a  secret that you never want anyone to know, or maybe it’s one that you  desperately wish someone would uncover. Or maybe, like me, you had a  secret that was discovered by a friend or loved one. Either way, we all know  what it’s like to have a secret like mine. We know how powerful and painful  secrets can be.

I decided that at the end of every day, I’d reflect upon my day and ask  myself one simple question:  If I had to tell a story from today — a five-minute story onstage about  something that took place over the course of this day — what would it be?  As benign and boring and inconsequential as it might seem, what was the  most storyworthy moment from my day?

You can begin by embracing the idea that simplicity is good, not bad. You don’t need to complicate things to “add value” for clients. Simple solutions are often the best solutions. Simplicity appears to be a lost art today. Between intricate sales funnels, complex onboarding procedures, and overly detailed business plans, it’s no wonder we overlook the obvious.

A commodity, as I define it, is a product available from many places. For that reason, it’s prone to purchases based on “price” instead of “value.” If all products are “equal,” then the cheapest one is the most valuable by default. In other words, if a prospect compares your product to another and thinks “these are pretty much the same, I’ll buy the cheaper one,” then they commoditized you.

Alright, let’s start by defining a Grand Slam Offer. It’s an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers . . . forever removing the cash constraint on business growth.

You spend the same amount of money for the same eyeballs. Then, you get 2.5x more people to respond to your advertisement because it’s a more compelling offer. From there, you close 2.5x as many people because the offer is so much more compelling. From there, you are able to charge a 4x higher price up front. The end result is 2.5 x 2.5 x 4 = 22.4x more cash collected up front. Yes, you spent $10,000 to make $112,000. You just made money getting new customers.

An example of this was the toilet paper shortage at the beginning of Covid-19. There was no offer. The pricing was atrocious. And there was no compelling sales pitch. But because the crowd was so big and so starving, rolls of toilet paper were going for $100 or more. That’s the value of a starving crowd.

Growing markets are like a tailwind. They make everything move forward faster. Declining markers are like headwinds. They make all efforts harder. This was Lloyd's example. Newspapers had three of the four makings of a great market: (1) lots of pain, (2) purchasing power, (3) easy to target. But they were shrinking (fast). No matter how hard he tried, the entire marketplace was fighting against him. Business is hard enough, and markets move quickly. So you might as well find a good market to give you a tailwind to make the process easier.

So if I were a relationship expert trying to find my avatar, I’d rather focus on “second half of life relationship” coaching for old timers than helping college students in relationships. Why? Because senior citizens who are alone are likely suffering more pain as they are nearer their deaths (pain), have more buying power (money), and are easy to find (targeting). Lastly, at the time of this writing, there are more people turning 65 each year than turning 20 (growing).

If you try one hundred offers, I promise you will succeed. Most people never try anything. Others fail once, then give up. It takes resilience to succeed. Stop personalizing! It’s not about you! If your offer doesn’t work, it doesn’t mean you suck. It means your offer sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying. So, try again. You’ll never become world class if you stop after a failed attempt.

The simplest way to increase the gap between price to value is by lowering the price. It’s also, most of the time, the wrong decision for the business. Getting people to buy is NOT the objective of a business. Making money is. And lowering price is a one-way road to destruction for most — you can only go down to $0, but you can go infinitely high in the other direction. So, unless you have a revolutionary way of decreasing your costs to 1/10th compared to your competition, don't compete on price.

One final point I want to drive home: if you offer a service where a customer must do something in order to achieve the result, or solve the problem you say you solve, they must be invested. The more invested they are, the more likely they are to achieve the positive result. Therefore, it follows that if you care about your customers, you should get them as invested as humanly possible. Ideally, this means pricing your services or product in such a way that it stings a little when they buy. That sting will force and focus their attention and their investment in your product or service. Those who pay the most, pay the most attention. And if your customers are more adherent and follow through, and if they achieve better results with your service than your competition, then you are in a very real way providing more value than anyone else. This is how you win.

But I know this isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. Your product must deliver. So many wish to shortcut the real work. Do that and you will fail. In the real world, to have the “gonads” to charge big ticket prices, you must outwork your self doubt. You must be so confident in your delivery, because you have done it so many times, that you know that this person will succeed.

From this point forward, you must abandon any notion you have about “what's fair.” Every enormous company in the world charges you money for things that cost them nothing. It costs pennies for the phone company to add an additional user, except they don’t mind charging you hundreds per month for access.

Many entrepreneurs believe that charging “too much” is bad. The reality is that, yes, you should never charge more than your product is worth. But you should charge far more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill it. Think up to a hundred times more, not just two or three times more.

In the beginning of my career, I focused all my attention on dream outcomes and the perception of achievement (social proof, third-party edification, etc). In other words, the top side of the equation. That’s where beginner marketers make bigger and bigger claims. It’s easy, and it’s lazy. But as time has gone on, I have realized that these larger-than-life claims are the easiest to establish (and therefore less unique). After all, anyone can make a promise. The harder, and more competitive, are the Time Delay and Effort & Sacrifice. The best companies in the world focus all their attention on the bottom side of the equation.

Or imagine hiring a marketing firm, and as soon as you sign your document, your phone begins ringing with new highly qualified prospects. How valuable would these products/services be? Infinitely valuable. And that’s the point.

Perception is reality. It’s not about how much you increase your prospect’s likelihood of success, or decrease the time delay to achievement, or decrease their effort and sacrifice. That in itself is not valuable. Many times, they will have no idea. The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives the decrease in time delay, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice.

A prime example of this happened in the London tunnel system. The biggest increase in rider satisfaction (aka value) was never from faster trains to decrease wait times. Instead, it was from a simple dotted map that showed them when the next train was coming and how long they had to wait. The dotted map, which only cost a few million dollars, decreased the riders’ perception of time delay and sacrifice (being bored waiting) more than actually making the trains faster (which costs billions of dollars to do). Isn’t that cool? This is how we need to think about our products.

Pro Tip: Logical vs Psychological Solutions Most people naturally try and solve problems using logical solutions. But the logical solutions have usually been tried...because they’re logical (it’s what everyone would try and do).

As a business owners and entrepreneurs I increasingly approach problems to find psychological solutions, rather than logical ones. Because if there were a logical solution, it probably would have already been solved, thereby eliminating the problem. All that’s left are the psychological problems.

Logical solution: make trains faster to increase satisfaction Psychological solution: decrease the pain of waiting by adding a dotted map Psychological solution: pay models to be the hostesses on the trip (people would wish it took longer to get to their destination!) Logical solution: make elevator faster Psychological solution: add floor to ceiling mirrors so people are distracted staring at themselves and forget how long they were on the elevator Logical solution: make it cheaper Psychological solution: make fewer of them and raise the price which causes people to want it more.

Often, most logical solutions have been tried and failed. At this point in history, we must give the psychological solutions a shot to solve problems.

In general, the dream outcome that most directly increases a prospect’s status will be the one they value most. As such, a prospect may value that entire category of vehicles that satisfy one desire more than another category that satisfies a different desire. For many men, making money is more important than being handsome.

So it’s not about the money, it's about the status (the perceived increase or decrease in relative standing when compared to others socially or professionally).

That being said, when comparing two products or services that satisfy the same desire, the value from the dream outcomes will cancel out (since they are the same). It will be the other three variables that drive the difference in perceived value, and ultimately price. For example, if we have two products or services that both help make someone beautiful, it will be the likelihood of achievement, time delay, and effort required that will differentiate the perceived value of each offer.

The thing people buy is the long-term value, aka their “dream outcome.” But the thing that makes them stay long enough to get it is the short-term experience. These are little milestones a prospect sees along the way that shows them they are on the right path. We try and tie as many of these as possible into any service we offer.

For example, it takes a while to add an extra $239,000 per year to a gym. But that’s what they’re buying. So, once they have purchased, we need to create emotional wins fast. One way we do this is to get their ads live and get them to close their first $2,000 sale within their first seven days. By doing this, their decision to work with us is reinforced, and they immediately trust us more. This makes them more likely to follow the rest of our systems and get to their ultimate destination.

Both surgeons take the same amount of time to do the surgery (if anything, the guy who has done it 10,000 times would likely get it done faster and still charge more). The more-experienced surgeon has a track record of achieving a result, which incentivizes their desirability. People value this perceived likelihood of achievement. Increasing a prospect’s conviction that your offer will “actually” work for them, will make your offer that much more valuable even though the work remains the same on your end. So to increase value with all offers, we must communicate perceived likelihood of achievement through our messaging, proof, what we choose to include or exclude in our offer, and our guarantees (more on these later). #3 Time Delay (Goal = Decrease) Time delay is the time between a client buying and receiving the promised benefit. The shorter the distance between when they purchase and they receive value/the outcome, the more valuable your services or product is. There are two elements to this driver of value: Long-term outcome and short-term experience. Many times, there are short-term experiences that occur while en route to the long-term outcomes. They happen “along the way” and provide value. It’s good to understand both. The thing people buy is the long-term value, aka their “dream outcome.” But the thing that makes them stay long enough to get it is the short-term experience. These are little milestones a prospect sees along the way that shows them they are on the right path. We try and tie as many of these as possible into any service we offer.

By doing this, their decision to work with us is reinforced, and they immediately trust us more. This makes them more likely to follow the rest of our systems and get to their ultimate destination. Pro Tip: Fast Wins Always try and incorporate short-term, immediate wins for a client. Be creative. They just need to know they are on the right path and that they made the right decision trusting you and your business.

If I sell someone a bikini body, their time delay to realize that outcome may be 12 months or even longer. Along the way, though, as they change their bodies, they may experience higher sex drive, more energy, and an increased community of friends.

Why? Because we wanted them to have a big, fast emotional win, so we could get them to commit to the long term.

This is why when you sell fitness, you have to spend an hour arm-wrestling a client to give over 1/10th to 1/100th of the amount of money they pay for surgery.

This is also the reason that the supplement industry ($123B, Grandview Research) is twice the size of the health club industry ($62B, IHRSA). They both accomplish the same perceived objectives — “being healthy,” “losing weight,” “looking good,” “increased energy,” etc. — but one is perceived as more valuable because it has lower “costs.”

Lifetime Value: The gross profit accrued over the entire lifetime of a customer. This is gross profit multiplied by the number of purchases an average customer will make over their lifetime. Using the example above, if the average customer stays five months, and they pay $1,000/mo while it costs me $100 per month to fulfill, then their lifetime value is $4,500.

When I was selling weight loss, I insisted that folks prepare all their food at home. I found it too difficult to help clients lose weight when they ate out because they always blew their diets. Rather than solve the problem, I insisted they do it my way, or not at all. As a result, I lost many sales.

One month I really needed to make some sales to pay rent. My next sale walked in the door - it was a business exec looking to lose weight. As we got into the sales presentation, she told me the program wouldn’t work for her because she went out to eat for lunch everyday. Normally, I would have lost this sale. I was a stickler for making people not eat out. But I really needed the money. Refusing to lose the sale because of this one thing, I conceded “I’ll make you an eating out guide for when you go to restaurants so you can eat our 100 percent of the time and still hit your goal. How does that sound?” She agreed, and I closed the sale.

Over time, I continued solving obstacles with templates and trainings until there were no more “one things” to prevent my sales. This lesson has stuck with me to this day. Don’t get romantic about how you want to solve the problem. Find a way to solve every problem a prospect presents with. When you do that, you make an offer that’s so good, people just can't say no. And that’s what we’re building here.

Now that we have enumerated our potential solutions, we will have a gigantic list. Next, I look at the cost of providing these solutions to me (the business). I remove the ones that are high cost and low value first. Then I remove low cost, low value items.

Example: Let’s say I moved in with someone and did their shopping, exercising, and cooking for them. They would probably believe they would definitely lose weight. But I am not willing to do that for any amount of money short of a gazillion dollars. The next question becomes, is there a lesser version of this experience that I can deliver at scale? Just take one step back at a time until you arrive at something that has a time commitment or cost you are willing to live with (or, obviously, massively increase your price so it becomes worth it for you — i.e., the gazillion dollars to live with someone).

If there’s one type of delivery vehicle to focus on, it’s creating high value, “one to many” solutions. These will be the ones that typically have the biggest discrepancy between cost and value.

For example, before I started my first gym, I had an online training business. I created a small excel sheet application that after inputting all of someone’s goals, automatically generated over 100 meals perfectly suited to their macronutrient and calorie needs. Better yet, depending which meals they selected, would tell them what they needed to buy at the grocery store in exact amounts, and how to prepare them in bulk for their exact amounts. It took me about 100 hours to put the whole thing together. But from that point going forward I sold truly personalized eating plans for very expensive prices, but they only took me about 15minutes to make. High value. Low cost.

That doesn’t mean you don’t ever want to do something in a small group or one-on-one model. After all, I do 1-on-1 with all of my portfolio company CEOs that we help scale past $30m+. You just want to make sure you save those high cost items for big value adds only. If you think you can accomplish the same value with a lower cost alternative, then do that instead.

Many of the “one to many” solutions require more up front work. Once created, however, they become valuable assets that create value in perpetuity. It’s worth putting in the time to create these because they will create high margin profit for years to come.

We went through this entire process to accomplish one objective: to create a valuable offer that is differentiated and unable to be compared to anything else in the marketplace. We are selling something unique. As such, we are no longer bound by the normal pricing forces of commoditization. Prospects will now only make a value-based rather than a price-based decision on whether they should buy from us. Hoorah!

It was a masterful display of human psychology at work in a setting where people were knowingly over-paying for products. The products remained unchanged, yet within this setting, an item that wouldn’t sell at a different venue for $10,000 sold for $100,000. That’s how powerful scarcity, urgency, and bonuses are.

As soon as we have them, our desire for them disappears. Therefore, if we seek to increase the demand (or desire), we must decrease or delay satisfying the desires of our prospects. We must sell fewer units than we otherwise can. Let that sit with you for a second.

In my experience, demand for services is non-linear. Instead, I’ve found demand to be fractal (80/20). In other words, one fifth of the prospects are willing to pay five times the price (or more).

In the example, I might have ten people willing to pay $500, but two of them willing to pay $5000. So, I would make more, have lower costs (more profits), provide more value, and increase the demand in the remaining prospect base by selling fewer units. Think about how exclusive scenario one vs scenario two would feel. Think about all the people who would want to purchase, but would not be able to. Would this increase or decrease their desire? It would increase it, of course.

On top of that, if people see that others who ‘were able to get in’ are loving it, it would further increase their desire. And the next time, they would act with more urgency, and be willing to pay more for the same thing than they originally did. So now, in the aftermath of our second scenario, we still have eight people who have unsatisfied desire. This increases their desire further. And to boot, we now have new prospects who weren't in the original pool who now want what we have.

If you satisfy zero desire (provide zero supply), you will not make money, and eventually leave people feeling rejected (Note: it takes much longer than you think). Conversely, if you satisfy all the demand, you will kill your golden goose, and not know where your next meal will come from. Mastering supply and demand comes from the elegant dance between the two. If you sleep with your significant other everyday they have less desire than if you haven’t slept with them for a week. We want the ravenous prospect, not merely the aroused.

These forces are often more powerful than your core offer. In this next section Enhancing Your Offer, I will show you how I: Use scarcity to decrease supply to raise prices (and indirectly increase demand through perceived exclusiveness) Use urgency to increase demand by decreasing the action threshold of a prospect. Use bonuses to increase demand (and increase perceived exclusivity). Use guarantees to increase demand by reversing risk. Use names to re-stimulate demand and expand awareness of my offer to my target audience.

The reason an authority (like a doctor), a celebrity (like Oprah), or a celebrity authority (like Dr.Oz or Dr.Phil) can charge egregious rates is because of implied demand. People assume that there is a lot of demand for their time, and, therefore, not a big supply of it. As a result, it must be expensive.

When there’s a fixed supply or quantity of products or services that are available for purchase it creates “scarcity” or a “fear of missing out.” It increases the need to take action, and by extension, purchase your offer.

Having limited releases is a tried and true method of using this psychological bias to your advantage.

Here’s why: it’s better to sell out consistently than over order and fail at creating that scarcity. This method stacks in effectiveness if it is done repeatedly over time (just not too often).

Second Important Note: When using this tactic, you must also let everyone know that you sold out. That is part of what makes it work so well. This way, even people who were on the fence, when they see that it was sold out, it gives social proof that other people thought it was worth it. And now that the choice has been made for them, they desire it more because there is no way they can get it. So the next time you make the offer they will be far more likely to take you up on it.

Chanel, a brand that has maintained insane margins and pricing for over a century, is a master of scarcity. They send only 1-2 of each piece to each store so every store has a different selection and every item is the last or second to last item in stock. This allows them to price far above market and turn buying impulses into purchases.

Total Business Cap - Only accepting….X Clients. Only accepting X clients at this level of service (on-going). This puts a cap on how many clients you service but also keeps them in it. You create a waiting list for new prospects. The moment the door opens, they jump right in and price resistance disappears. Periodically, you can increase capacity by 10-20% then cap it again. This works well for your highest tiers or service levels.

This is like saying “My agency only will service twenty-five customers total. Period.” Over time you can increase your prices and squeeze the lower performing accounts out and bring in new more profitable accounts, or, you can periodically ‘open slots’ as your capacity allows (always leaving some demand unmet).

Growth Rate Cap - Only accepting X clients per week (on-going) “We only accept 5 new clients per week and we already have the first 3 spots taken. I have 6 more calls this week, so you can take the spot or one of my next calls and you can wait until we reopen.” I have used this method since the beginning of my business. I always knew what my capacity was per week, and simply chose to let our prospects know how many openings we had left. This banks on the fact that you can only handle a certain amount of new clients anyways, on a regular basis, so you might as well let them know it.

Cohort Cap - Only accepting….X clients per class or cohort. Similar to the above, except done on whatever cadence you desire. Only accepting X amount per class or cohort over a given period is another way of thinking about it. Imagine you only start clients monthly or quarterly. This helps you get some cadences in place in your business operationally while also allowing your sales team some legitimate scarcity. Example: “We take on 100 clients 4 times a year. We open the doors then close them.” Etc.

Pro Tip - Provide Limited Access For Higher Ticket Services These scarcity tactics work especially well for higher ticket upsells. If you want to create one off workshops, trainings, events, seminars, consulting, etc. These are things that by their nature take time and provide more access. Paring them with clear scarcity or fixed amounts, seats, or spots will rapidly drive up the demand. But always remember have less spots available than you think you can sell . . . so that when you want to do it again in the future, everyone will remember you sold out . . . fast. This is a compounding strategy that increases in effectiveness over time. One of the few in the marketing arsenal.

Let me give you a real example of scarcity to enhance the value of a free lead magnet. If I were to tell you right now that I have a checklist that you can download for free that has all these materials for you in this book in bulleted format, you might be inclined to put this book down and go there to download it now. But, if I told you I have it set so that every week the page only allows twenty new people to download it, you’d be far more likely to go see if you can grab it. And even more so if when you try it, you see that it has already run out for the week. Result? You join a list that notifies you the next time twenty more checklists become available for download. What happens next? When you get that notification, you’ll hit the link on your phone and go to the page because you don’t want to miss out again.

if you want to immediately make a lot of money, create a very exclusive service level based on access to you (yes, unscalable), that you cap at a tiny number. Price it very high. Then, tell people. You will make more money than you thought possible. These also tend to be some of the best clients. And limit your delivery to something that you don’t hate. For me, I hate emails and messages but dont mind zoom calls. Make it work for your working style. The cream of the crop (the 1% of 1% will adjust and take action).

Pro Tip - Once You’re Out, You Can Never Come Back You can create scarcity by also capping your service level and saying that if they leave than can never return. This type of scarcity makes people think extra hard about leaving. I started doing this with my gyms early on. Then I was in a mastermind that employed this. Then I started using it in my higher level of Gym Lords. This works best with small groups (like the above example). As groups become much bigger, the tactic loses some teeth (speaking from experience).

My favorite way of doing this is having cohorts of clients start on a regular cadence. This has the added operational benefit of helping you create a choreographed onboarding experience for new clients. As you scale, this will become increasingly important.

1) Cohort-Based Rolling Urgency For example, if you start clients every week (even in unlimited amounts), you can say: “If you sign up today, I can get you in with our next group that kicks off on Monday, otherwise you’ll have to wait until our next kickoff date.” If you wanted to juice it up a little bit, you could say: “I actually had a client who signed up a few weeks ago drop out, so I have an opening for our next cohort that kicks off on Monday. If you are pretty sure you’re gonna do this sooner or later, might as well get in on it now so you can start reaping the rewards sooner rather than paying the same and waiting.”

Obviously the less frequently you kick off new customers, the more powerful this is. For example, if you only start clients two times a year, people will be very inclined to sign up, especially as the date approaches. Even starting new clients every other week can confer this urgency nudge.

Just like guarantees, there is always a fear that you will make less money by employing this strategy. We are afraid that we will lose sales we would have otherwise made. Every experienced marketer on the planet will tell you - it is a fear, and it is unfounded. The biggest sales on a week long campaign or launch happen in the last 4 hours of the last day (up to 50-60%). That means that the last 3% of the time allotted creates 50-60% of the sales...that’s completely illogical, but also unmistakably human.

So, just like a guarantee, you will make more money from the many people who decided to take action than people who actually missed out because in reality, those people were never going to buy (heck, they didn't even buy when they had their fee to the fire, so why would they without?) Good to remember.

What to do if you just started a cohort and someone wants to buy…. You have two options: 1) you can offer them a speedy personalized onboarding to get them up to speed as a “bonus” for signing up today and still get them in. Or, my preference, 2) You can explain to them that since the next group starts in a little, they will have the advantage of having more time to review the materials, talk to their employees (for b2b products) or family members ( for b2c products). On top of that, they can have a more extended payment plan that you can only make available to them since the start date is so far out . . . an advantage that most clients do not get. In the end, remember, you always have the advantage because you are the one who calls the shots.

Pro Tip - Clean Your Pipeline With Every Price Change: If you ever really are planning on raising your prices (hopefully soon if you are reading this book!) then you can always clean out your pipeline by letting people know “The price is going up! So get in now!” Never raise your prices without letting people know. It shows a position of strength and will give you a nice little influx of cash from the people in the pipeline who were on the fence.

Example: If I was explaining an arbitrage opportunity between buying products on ebay and selling them on amazon, this market inefficiency would over time correct itself. The sooner someone acts the better it will be for them. This could be true for selling someone on the opportunity of trading crypto currencies, buying a stock, getting into a new platform to advertise before competitors jump on the bandwagon.

The main point I want you to take away from this is that a single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its component parts and stacked as bonuses (see image).

The reason this works is we are increasing the prospect’s price-to-value discrepancy by increasing the value delivered instead of cutting the price. We anchor the price we tell them to the core offer. Then with each increasingly valuable bonus, that discrepancy grows wider and wider until it's too big to bear and we snap the rubber band in their mind that is holding their wallet in their pocket.

Pro Tip: Add Bonuses Instead of Discounting Whenever Possible on Core Offers Whenever trying to close a deal, never discount the main offer. It teaches your customers that your prices are negotiable (which is terrible). Adding bonuses to increase value to close the deal is far superior to cutting prices. It puts you in a position of strength and goodwill rather than weakness.

When selling one on one, you ask for the sale first, before offering the bonuses. If they say yes, then after they have signed up, you let them know the additional bonuses they're going to get. This creates a wow experience and reinforces their decision to buy.

On the other hand, if the person does not buy after the first ask, then you present a bonus that matches their perceived obstacle, then ask again. Don’t feel weird about asking again. You simply agree with the prospect, add the bonus, and ask if this consolation was “Fair enough.” People have a hard time rejecting reciprocity, so adding a bonus to accommodate, then another, then another, and people will feel almost obligated to buy from you.

10. The value of the bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer. Psychologically as you continue to add offers, it continues to expand the price to value discrepancy. It also, subconsciously communicates that the core offer must be valuable because if these are the bonuses, the main thing has to be more valuable than the bonuses right? (No, but you can use this psychological bias to make your offer seem wildly compelling).

Go to those businesses, get a deal for them they could never get for themselves (because you are negotiating with the purchasing power of all your customers at once, very powerful).

The longer you are in business the more of these bonus assets you will have at your disposal. All of these things are valuable. Put them in a vault and keep them in your back pocket to sprinkle into an offer to get the deal closed. Information products work very well here because they have high perceived value, low cost, and zero operational effort besides giving an additional login. Tickets to virtual experiences or events work too. Same goes for a higher level of service that has a fixed cost like giving someone VIP service for a month (which also doubles as a way of upselling them into that level of service to keep them on it . . . more on that in Book II.)

Would you be excited about the  offer?  Probably not. But place that heartfelt, deeply resonant story on an island  full of dinosaurs, and your opinion may change. And you’ll probably leave  the theater thinking that the movie was great. You’ll find it lingering in your  mind and heart longer than any dinosaur movie before or since. You’ll think  it was because of the action and suspense, and that might be some of it, but  deep in your bones, you’ll love the story because it wasn’t about dinosaurs.  It was about transformation and love.

Another example: Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first (and best) of  Spielberg’s Indiana Jones films. You might think it’s a story about a man  who is trying to find a religious artifact before the Nazis can get their hands  on it. You might even think that it’s a love story between Indy and Marion.  Nope. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a story about a man who lacks faith. He  does not believe in God. Indiana Jones is all science and no spirituality.  Then, in his most desperate moment, he finds faith when he needs it most.

Warning: While guarantees can be effective sellers, people who buy because of guarantees can become very shitty customers. A person who only buys because of a guarantee is a person who may not be willing to put in the work necessary to see success with your product or service. In a world where you want to reverse risk and get customers the best outcome possible, tying your guarantee to the things they need to do to be successful can help all parties.

After a moment of feeling my feelings, which felt like an eternity, I felt a bit more calm. Even thoughts like, I hope this man will buy himself some nice new pants and slippers from my money, popped up. I blessed him and appreciated him for caring about his kids so much. My anger was gone and was replaced by appreciation. I looked at the timer. Three minutes had gone by. I know for a fact that if I hadn’t put on that timer and allowed myself to feel my feelings, to this day, I would still feel mad about what happened. Instead, it took me three minutes to alchemize my anger into appreciation.

In the early days of alchemy, men believed that us humans could change the physical qualities of an object by changing ourselves from within. This was based on the principle that whenever we change, our whole world and existence changes with us. By becoming the best version of ourselves, we make space for the world to do the same thing; become its best version.

Instead of third normal form, dimension tables typically are highly denormalized with flattened many-to-one relationships within a single dimension table. Because dimension tables typically are geometrically smaller than fact tables, improving storage efficiency by normalizing or snowflaking has virtually no impact on the overall database size. You should almost always trade off dimension table space for simplicity and accessibility.

close your eyes. Sit down and ask yourself what you WANT to do here on earth. - Why is earth a better place now that you are there?
- What do others appreciate about yourself?
- What is something you consider to be normal, but other people thank you for? Keep your eyes closed and listen to your thoughts. Write all your ideas down when you feel ready, and repeat the exercise tomorrow. You will notice that some ideas bring about a spark from inside you. You will feel the energy rushing through your body and you will feel excitement. Follow that feeling, because that can be the reason why you would get up in the morning.

Your intuition has a direct bond with the all-knowing world, the collective
subconsciousness, as Freud liked to call it. This all-knowing world is separate from the world that we are capable of perceiving with our naked eye. It is the inner world that makes it possible for our world to exist.

Do you feel that your intuition speaks to you, but do you choose to ignore it anyway? Then you miss out on your chance to be guided by it. Life will know that whenever you make a decision, you’re not serious about it. The next time you make a decision, life will take you less seriously. This has the possibility of creating damage to different aspects of your life. Apparently you do not stand behind the choices you make, is what life will think. Therefore it is extremely important that you follow up on the decisions that you make, and to listen to your intuition when you choose to do so.

Whenever you start to walk the path with your intuition guiding you, you will notice that you get to a point in life where you can ask yourself and your intuition ANYTHING. Suddenly you have access to the answers of questions you have never thought of before. Slowly but surely you will gain more clarity about life, and you will turn into a happier version of yourself. The longer you listen to your intuition, the clearer it will speak to you, and after a while it will never leave you again.

What do you notice when you do this
experiment? How does it feel to say this to yourself? What thoughts come up? Is it easy to say this? Is it easy to hear it? Or do you notice a certain tension, a trigger? Do you recognize fear or love? Maybe both?
Chances are that you notice yourself not believing the words you’re saying and hearing. Maybe you feel a certain resistance. It could even be the case that you are too afraid to look at yourself at all. That is completely normal. You are not the only one.

There are several levels we will go through to prepare ourselves for success. First, we will define what success means to us. Then we will establish the right ‘why’, after which we will ask ourselves what we need to think, say, or do to get there. The level after that has to do with accepting the current reality we’re in, in order to invite the new reality into being. When all of that is done we have two more levels to go through: choosing success and welcoming success.

‘Why?’  ‘Because I love myself. I am done with being lazy. I do not enjoy that experience. I want to have a positive impact on the world and that starts with having a positive impact on myself. I want to do more of that which makes me happy. I want to go on another holiday, I want a new car, I want clean shoes, I want more time with my kids, I want to get rid of the awful feeling I get each time the energy bill falls on the doormat, and I want to make my parents proud!’ ‘Wow, wow, wow.

There have been many occasions in which I started a coaching relationship with someone and after a few sessions they told me:
‘But I did not know it would take that much energy…’  New results take energy, time, effort and the right mindset. That’s what you believe and this book is simply reflecting it back to you and helping you deal with it. So when you want to achieve the results that you desire you will have to put in the energy, time, effort, and right mindset.

Considering the sources of the imprinting process, Lorenz had determined, on the basis of his observation that many young birds are not fed by their parents but rather feed themselves, that the strong imprinting bond that develops between the baby and mother duck occurs independent of parental feeding of the duckling. Likewise, Bowlby believed that the intense bond between the human infant and his or her mother is not due simply to feeding behavior

Exploratory behavior is antithetical to attachment behavior in that it leads the infant toward interesting features of his environment and thus usually away from the attachment figure. If, however, the baby is alarmed, attachment behavior as well as wary/fearful behavior tends to be activated.

The greater the felt sense of security and confidence in the availability of the caregiver, the greater the infant’s exploration. If the infant ventures too far and becomes fearful or becomes insecure about the caregiver’s availability, he or she will likely return to the caregiver and then, once reassured, will resume exploration.

it is clear that both temperament and the early attachment relationship contribute to later development and to the emergence of psychopathology in adulthood. Second, the four prototypical child patterns of attachment—secure, avoidant, ambivalent/resistant, and disorganized—are a robust finding across many studies. Furthermore, the data consistently reveal that these patterns remain relatively stable across time unless altered by unusual life circumstances such as divorce, family dysfunction, or extreme stress

Hausa men in Nigeria typically have four or five wives, so the babies have four to five caregivers in addition to their biological mother. The children remain in close physical proximity to one or more caregivers at all times, as babies are not allowed to explore the wider environment because of physical danger. While this study did not use Ainsworth’s three-way classification, the study demonstrated secure attachment to multiple caregivers and also highlighted the principle that a secure base of attachment protects the baby from physical danger

In the working model of the world that anyone builds, a key feature is his notion of who attachment figures are, where they may be found, and how they may be expected to respond. Similarly, in the working model of the self that anyone builds a key feature is his notion of how acceptable or unacceptable he himself is in the eyes of his attachment figures. On the structure of these complementary models are based that person’s forecasts of how accessible and responsive his attachment figures are likely to be should he turn to them for support . . . whether he feels confident that his attachment figures are in general readily available or whether he is more or less afraid that they will not be available—occasionally, frequently, or most of the time.

The child’s early attachment experiences . . . cause him to establish an internal model that organizes and directs not only his feelings and behavior “but also attention, memory, and cognition,” to the extent that such mental functions are related to attachment. As a result, people with different attachment histories not only have different patterns of behavior but different “patterns of language and structures of mind.”

The Dynamic-Maturational Model of attachment and adaptation defines attachment as three-entwined components: (1) relationships focused on protection and comfort; (2) patterns of mental processing of information about danger and sexual opportunity; and (3) strategies for self-protection, reproduction and protection of progeny.

Mentalization is defined as making sense of the actions of oneself and others on the basis of intentional mental states, such as desires, feelings, and beliefs. [It] entails the recognition that what is in the mind is in the mind. It reflects the knowledge of one’s own and other’s mental states as mental states.

Stern sees intersubjectivity less as something innate and more as a phenomenon arising out of the reciprocal interactions between infant and mother over time. It begins with the infant’s acute awareness of the other, and, through mutually regulated interactions, infant and mother both learn the rules of interactions and represent and interpret the meaning of each other’s behavior. Stern’s work is notable for its emphasis on dyadic affect attunement.

By the end of the first year of life, the baby begins to develop the capacity for symbolic thinking and thereby is able to make a neural representation of subjectivity and intersubjectivity. In other words, by this age, the child has begun to develop a theory of one’s own mind as well as of the mind of the other.

Stern believes that attachment and intersubjectivity are separate and complementary motivational systems. The attachment system balances our related needs for the security of physical proximity and the learning that exploration makes possible. The intersubjective system is driven by our need to know and be known by others. If attachment exists to foster felt security, intersubjectivity exists to promote the experience of psychic intimacy and belonging

Those [mothers] whose babies tended to be ambivalently attached to them misattuned to a broad spectrum of the baby’s emotional expression, but were extremely attentive and well attuned when the baby was afraid. They were, in effect, training him to see fear as a primary means of achieving a sense of relatedness to another person. Mothers whose babies tended to be avoidantly attached to them, on the other hand, were most likely to misattune to the infant when he was expressing a negative feeling, especially toward them, or when he was seeking comfort or reassurance. Such mothers excelled, however, in attuning to their baby’s exuberance, especially when he was mastering some new toy or game.

My contingent coordination with her rhythms constituted the process of how I reached for her, how I tried to sense her state, and she could come and sense mine. Both Stern (1985) and Trevarthen (1998) argue that matching of communicative expressions simultaneously regulates both interpersonal contact and inner state. Dolores gradually came to sense a “comforted” inner state as she became more aware of how I matched her and coordinated with her. Thus correspondences of expressions through time, form, and intensity provided a powerful nonverbal mode of therapeutic action.

Another way of describing Beebe’s verbal technique is by saying she used “motherese” in attempting to evoke new capacities for attachment-oriented communication in Dolores.

During the third and fourth weeks of life, the infant begins to show a clear visual preference for the human face (Stechler & Carpenter, 1967; Wolff, 1969) and thus more frequently and for longer periods looks at humans who are near. By the fourth week, the infant develops head orientation toward others, and shortly thereafter shows preferential orientation toward the primary caregiver (Izard, 1971) and direct eye-to-eye contact and a smiling response to that contact

Seven of these patterns are likely to be seen during Phase 2 in relation to a particular or possibly several close caretakers (e.g., the infant’s mother and father): visual-motor orientation, termination of crying, smiling, vocalization, greeting (with vocalization and/or smiling and/or reaching), climbing and exploring, and, toward the end of this phase, crying when the caregiver leaves.

Facial displays and internal visceral experience become synchronized, facilitated by attuned engagement and responsiveness from the caregiver: Interpersonally, the integration of affective expression and experience constitutes the outcome of careful mirroring of the child’s internal state upon the care-giver’s recognition of an affective display. When the mother says to the child, “Don’t be frightened,” the mother acknowledges the child’s affective display and simultaneously draws attention to the child’s internal visceral experience. As this empathic response is repeated during many infant–care-giver interactions, synchronization of affective expression and experience is increased.

Affective states become embedded in a dynamic web of internal representations of self and other, giving the representations an affective component. The infant now carries internal representations of the self, of the attachment figure, of the relationship, and of the experiential quality of the relationship. Feelings about the self and others become linked to their internal images, and the infant gains the ability to represent the affective quality of interactions.

Marvin and Britner attribute this shift to changes in the dynamics of the internal working models that result from developments in the child’s information-processing capacities between three and a half and five years of age. “No longer limited to sequential processing through a chain-linked network of thoughts-images-plans, this older preschooler can now comprehend two or more of these images as component parts of yet a higher-order image-goal-plan”

There is a metaphor that I use to describe how Zen understands the transcendent: when we watch a movie we are entirely wrapped up in the movie, in the loves and hates, the dilemmas and the resolutions. It is all “real.” At the end of the movie all that is left is the white light on the screen, and we say, “The movie is over.” Yet all that we saw was simply manifestations of the white light. It was the white light that made it “real.” The light was beyond, or transcended, the images that we saw on the screen.

Holmes says, “The secure base is never entirely safe. Breaks, gaps, and losses are as intrinsic to the rhythm of life as are attachment and connectedness” (1996, p. 54). Over time the patient learns to “disengage from defensive attachments” (p. 62) and forms a new secure attachment pattern (p. 59), which becomes the template for healthy adult intimacy (p. 196). A central goal is the “development of a healing narrative” (p. 31), and through this newly established meaning system, the patient becomes more able to tolerate separation anxiety (p. 61), which leads to autonomy and, in the context of the therapy, independence from the therapist.

3. Mapping out past IWMs of attachment. Sable states: Therapists help clients map out their attachment experiences so they can then ideally make more authentic relationships in the “real world” (2000, p. 345) . . .

The final step is reflective and integrative . . . Integration involves reconsidering one’s experience, both past and present, from multiple perspectives to gain an understanding of what one has experienced, how one used that experience to develop self-protective strategies, the influence of change in oneself (including maturation) and in one’s context on the adaptiveness of one’s strategies, and, finally, one’s emerging ability to regulate the process of development in the future. The outcome of this iterative integrative process is greater flexibility, greater satisfaction in one’s entire developmental progress, a more compassionate understanding of the limitations of important other people such as one’s parents, and optimism that one could face new adversities and still protect oneself and one’s loved ones.

Mentalization entails making sense of the actions of oneself and others on the basis of intentional mental states, such as desires, feelings, and beliefs. It involves the recognition that what is in the mind is in the mind, and reflects knowledge of one’s own and others’ mental states as mental states.

The Rome School’s research has identified six very specific metacognitive skills, or modules (Prunetti et al., 2008, p. 32): 1. Identification: the ability to distinguish, recognize, and define one’s own inner states (emotions, cognitions). 2. Differentiation: the ability to recognize that the contents of representations are subjective events of a mental nature and, therefore, are different from reality (Semerari et al., 2003, p. 242). Differentiation also includes distinguishing fantasy from reality (Dimaggio, Semerari, Carcione, Nicolò, & Procacci, 2007, p. 15). 3. Relating variables: the ability to establish relations among separate components of a mental state and between components of mental states and behavior (Semerari et al., 2003, p. 242). 4. Integration: the ability to work out coherent descriptions of one’s mental state and processes (Semerari et al., 2003, p. 242). Integration also entails developing an integrated point of view as well as showing consistency from one state of mind to the next (Dimaggio et al., 2007, p. 18). 5. Decentration: the ability to comprehend another individual’s mental state from a non-egocentric perspective (Semerari et al., 2003, p. 244). 6. Mastery: the ability to work through one’s representations and mental states with a view to implementing effective action strategies in order to accomplish cognitive tasks or cope with problematic mental states (Semerari et al., 2003, p. 244).

Cooperative motives, as attachment ones, involve feelings of safeness: individuals must feel safe enough to come into proximity long enough and to share and also not be cheated or exploited. Indeed sharing, working out what others want and giving it to them, then being appreciated in return, is a common source of pleasure and relationship building.

Because our first relational experiences are mainly lived outside the domain of language, our crucial internalizations of early relationships register as representations, rules, and models that cannot be linguistically retrieved. For these hard-to-reach representations to later be modified . . . they must be accessed, that is, experientially engaged. In therapy, such representations in the patient often become accessible only as they are communicated through other-than-verbal channels . . .

Wallin says that secure base is promoted by collaborative communication, which involves four essential elements: (1) fostering a collaborative dialogue that is inclusive of all domains of experience, (2) actively identifying ongoing ruptures and fostering repair; (3) upgrading the dialogue and the mentalizing to “higher levels of awareness” (Wallin, 2007, p. 198), and (4) providing a real relationship in which patient and therapist alike struggle with and fully engage each other.

Mindfulness also offers something that mentalizing does not. For the mindful self is aware of the reflective self—and aware as well that reflecting upon experience is entirely different from being fully present to experience. Through repeatedly becoming aware of awareness, we “shift the locus of subjectivity from representations of self to awareness itself.”

The representational map for attachment, or internal working model, is the earliest to develop, forming between 12 and 20 months, concurrent with the development of symbolic or representational thinking (see Chapter 2). By the end of the second year, one of the four main types of attachment—secure, ambivalent/resistant, avoidant, or disorganized—is stably established, both as an internal working model and as a resulting pattern of attachment behavior.

Whenever trauma or abuse is evident in the history, the therapist also determines whether trauma bonding is present. Then, it becomes necessary for the therapist and patient to decide together whether the relational disturbance is related primarily to attachment, CCRT, or trauma. Based on this determination, a very specific treatment plan is developed.

then the patient and therapist together continuously explore, shape, and reformulate the imagery within the context of their interactions, which are much like the mutually regulated and co-created interactions of the infant and his or her caregiver. By collaboratively constructing and reconstructing, by continuously changing and refining the ideal parent figure imagery, the patient and the therapist co-create new, positive attachment experience and a new, positive attachment map.

the therapist tailors the imagery frame to address specific patient-reported early experiences of failed attachment-promoting care. For example, when parental unresponsiveness, inconsistency, rejection, or failed contingency-matching have occurred in the patient’s caregiver-of-origin experience, the therapist introduces ideal parent figures who embody the positive opposites of these—parent figures who are extraordinarily responsive, consistent, accepting, and matching of the child’s behavior, respectively.

At each stage of development, attuned parents help their child to find what is called in the peak performance field “the right skill-to-challenge ratio,” which promotes optimal functioning and development and can elicit in the child the state of “being in the flow” (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) of his or her own experience (Meins, 1997).

Parents of secure children who develop a strong, autonomous, and complex sense of self are champions of their children’s best self-development. The child comes to know that the parents have a deep faith in him or her, in such a way that the child is free to explore, discover, succeed and fail, and, through such exploration, develop the best, strongest, and most unique sense of self.

Rather than drawing boundaries based on organizational departments, dimensional models should be organized around business processes, such as orders, invoices, and service calls. Multiple business functions often want to analyze the same metrics resulting from a single business process. Multiple extracts of the same source data that create multiple, inconsistent analytic databases should be avoided.

at the onset of treatment the therapist engages the patient in developing a collaboratively established, mutually agreed-upon treatment frame—a clear understanding of what is expected from both the patient and therapist during the course of therapy. Throughout the treatment, when the patient behaves in any way that goes against the treatment frame or interferes with the therapy, such as repeatedly missing or coming late to sessions or failing to pay fees, the therapist immediately and explicitly confronts the patient about this behavior as noncollaborative.

In our approach, the therapist begins with careful observation and identification of the main patterns of mismatching and poor nonverbal communication between patient and therapist by paying attention to chair position, posture, head orientation, gaze, eye contact, facial affective display, self-touch, postural gestures, breathing patterns, and vocal rhythm, tone, and pitch. The therapist strives to increase nonverbal matching in these areas, and where the patient’s nonverbal communication is most dysfunctional (e.g., never making eye contact), the therapist verbally brings the patient’s attention to the pattern. Such pointing out enhances the patient’s metacognitive awareness, both of the impaired nonverbal pattern of communication and of its antecedent states of mind (e.g., specific emotions, or underlying maladaptive schemas or negative self-talk). These methods will support the emergence of healthy patterns of nonverbal collaborativeness between patient and therapist,

Insecure preoccupied adults frequently make irrelevant comments, wander off topic, lose track of the point, and use passive, vague, or jargon expressions in ways that make their verbal communications difficult to follow. Insecure dismissing adults do not express important points in sufficient detail and depth. In therapy, when patterns of noncollaborative verbal behavior appear, the therapist points these out to the patient and highlights that they limit the shared goal of mutual understanding and communication and explores their antecedent states of mind.

It is essential to live with the conviction that you are making history for the next generation. There isn’t anyone else around who will do it. You have to realize this and plant your roots deeply. All most people see when they look at a large tree are the leaves and flowers, but it’s the roots that you have to pay attention to. A tree won’t develop fully unless the roots are buried deep. When the roots are in deep, then the tree will grow and beautiful flowers will blossom naturally.

“Did it ever occur to you that this feeling of dissatisfaction or emptiness might be caused by your searching for the value, the basis, or recognition of your existence only in things outside yourself, such as in your property, or in work, or in your reputation? This empty feeling of yours probably comes up because you haven’t yet found this basis within the reality of your own true self. In other words, you feel a hollowness in your life because you have always lived only in relation to other people and things, and haven’t been living out your true self.”9

What is this thing we casually call “I”? It seems that this “I” stands out in relief only in opposition to or in encountering some “other.” For example, a man may see himself as something called a “husband” that exists in relation to his “wife” and a “parent” with respect to his “child.” At work, he may feel that his identity as a “subordinate” is determined by his relation to his “superiors.” Furthermore, he may regard himself as a “salesman” with respect to his “customers,” a “competitor” with respect to others in the same line of business, a “poor man” with respect to a “rich one,” unable to buy something he imagines as a good thing, a “loser” in contrast to a “winner,” “powerless” in the face of society, and on and on, endlessly. It would be a wonder if a man whose awareness of himself was based on comparisons like these didn’t become overwhelmed with feelings of inferiority. (

Most religions encourage believers to “remember” events written in their holy books, events that may have happened thousands of years ago, and to act as if these things had happened to them personally. On the basis of these “memories” they wage wars and kill each other en masse. This is not limited to mythological and sectarian religions, either. It is exactly the same among all the many doctrines and ways of thought. Instead of looking at the fresh and vivid reality of life with their own eyes, people end up stifling that reality in the name of justice, or peace, or some fixed dogma.

Later in the protocol, the therapist draws from knowledge of the patient’s unique attachment history to suggest specific attachment-promoting qualities if they do not appear spontaneously in the patient’s imagery.

The therapist begins the IPF protocol by helping the patient to establish a calm, relaxed, inwardly focused state of awareness. Such a state increases the likelihood of greater vividness of imagery and decreases the interference of distractions.

During the critical period of attachment formation, 12 to 20 months, identity is primarily body-based and memory is behavioral/enacted rather than mental/narrative. Thus, enhancing the patient’s engagement with his or her immediate body experience establishes the most fertile ground for the evoked ideal parent imagery to take root as a new attachment representation.

Take a few moments to settle comfortably into your chair [sofa], letting yourself move or shift or adjust the body in any way that supports your growing sense of comfort. That’s right, whatever helps you feel more at ease, more relaxed, more at rest. And as you bring your attention even more to the felt sense of the body, notice that you don’t have to make any effort at all to be supported there by the chair. You can let the chair do all the work. Notice how, as the muscles of the body realize that they don’t have to make any effort to support the body, the muscles relax even more, let go even more, and you can feel even more at ease and relaxed.

Deepen the inwardly focused state. For additional deepening, we like the simplicity and efficiency of a method originally formulated by Charcot (1886): And now, each time you inhale, let the eyes open fully, and each time you exhale, let the eyes fully and gently close. And as you do that, give close attention to the sensations, the sensations and feelings of the movements of the eyes and the movements of the breath. That’s right, just like that.

The therapist continues to make supportive, focusing comments, watching closely and matching verbalizations to where the patient is in the cycle of eye movements and breath: Inhaling, opening the eyes . . . and exhaling, closing the eyes. Good. Just like that.

And now, become even more aware of the exhalations. Each time you exhale, let the release of the breath bring a release of any tension, tightness, or stress that you’d like to let go of. Really feel the release, the letting go. Notice how each time you exhale, you can feel even more calm, even more relaxed, even more at ease . . . And soon it will feel natural to let the eyes remain closed, both on the exhalation and on the inhalation too. When it feels natural to let the eyes remain closed, they can remain closed, and you can become even more aware of the exhalations. Even more aware of the calming, the relaxing, the letting go that gets even more clear with each exhalation. And any tension, tightness, or stress that you’d like to release just rides out on the exhaled breath, and drifts farther and farther away from you, harmlessly into the atmosphere. As you become even more relaxed, more at ease, you’ve probably noticed that the breath gets a little longer, a little slower, all by itself, without any effort to make it so. And you might notice the space, the space at the end of each exhalation, before the beginning of the next inhalation. Even though this space is only a few moments in time, notice how still and quiet it can be. And you can relax even more, as you notice that stillness and quiet.

A final step for enhancing a positive body state and focus is a brief body scan: And now, you can let the breath fade into the background of awareness. I’d like you now to look through the body, and find where in the body is the place that is most comfortable, most relaxed, most at ease. Look all through the body, and when you find the place that is most comfortable, most relaxed, most at ease, you can let me know where that is.

The patient indicates, verbally or by pointing, for example, the shoulders: Yes. Really focus on the feeling in the shoulders. And notice what’s there that lets you know how very comfortable, how very relaxed, how very at ease the shoulders are. And the more you’re aware of that comfortable, relaxed feeling, the stronger and clearer it becomes. And soon that feeling will begin to spread, spread beyond the shoulders, bringing that comfortable and relaxed feeling beyond the shoulders to everywhere in the body. Notice how it’s spreading now. Yes, that’s right. More and more comfortable, more and more relaxed.

Evoke experience of a child-self state. The first step is to orient the patient’s imagination to childhood. And now we’re going to take a journey back, a journey back in time, a journey back in time to when you were a young child. So imagine now, going back in time, back to when you were a young child. You can begin to imagine yourself as a young child, and more and more feel yourself as a young child.

Prompt for ideal parent figure imagery. When the patient nods, the imagination is invited to create ideal parent figures. Now, as a young child, imagine being with parents, but not the parents you grew up with in your family. Imagine now being with a different set of parents, parents who are ideally suited to you and to your nature. These parents are right there with you and really know how to be with you to help you feel so safe and secure. These parents really know how to be with you in all the ways that help you to feel absolutely secure in relationship with them. If you’d like, you can incorporate positive aspects from experiences you’ve had, but imagine ideal fictional parents, created entirely by your imagination, because you can change the imagination and keep changing it until you have it just right, with these parents having all the qualities that help you to feel so safe and so secure in relationship with them. These parents really know how to be with you, in all the ways that you most need. Notice the ways that they’re being with you. Notice how you feel as they’re with you in all the ways that you most need and in all the ways that are so very right for you and your well-being.

It is important that the therapist uses the word “imagine” rather than “visualize.” When a patient is asked to imagine, he or she is free to draw from any or all sense modalities, whereas being asked to visualize limits what can be incorporated into the creation of the ideal parents. Many patients will spontaneously generate visual images, but using “imagine” in the guiding phrasing respects that for some people, the visual is not the primary imaginative domain. And the more you imagine the details of being with these parents now, the more the feelings of security will become clearer and more and more vivid. You can really feel it, how that feels. And if there’s anything you want to change about the ways that they’re being with you, that might contribute to you feeling even more safe, even more comfortable, even more secure with them, with your imagination you can change what’s happening in any ways you’d like. You can change anything about them or about being with them so that it feels even more right and beneficial for you now.

Inquire about the patient’s imagery. The therapist then asks the patient to describe the experience of the ideal parents. This inquiry provides information about the patient’s experience of the method and whether any modifications to the initial imagery are needed before proceeding. As these parents become more and more clear to you, perhaps you wouldn’t mind describing these parents and about the ways they’re being with you. You can let the words to describe them and your experience of them just spontaneously arise, and as you speak, the sense of being with these parents can get even more clear and vivid.

Assess the adequacy of the patient’s initial parent figure imagery. The patient’s initial report about the imagery lets the therapist know how to proceed. Ideally, the patient would describe a multisensory experience of two parent figures who are not the patient’s actual parents or people known to him or her and would describe these parent figures behaving in at least some attachment-promoting ways. As illustrated and described in the section below, “Principles and Practices for Framing and Responding to Patients’ Experiences,” the therapist would then respond by mirroring and enhancing the presence of the parent figures and their beneficial ways of being. However, because the presence of an attachment disorder indicates the absence of a positive internal working model or map of attachment, it is common for this ideal initial imagery scenario not to occur. If not ideal, adequate initial imagery would include: 1. At least one parent figure who is not one of the patient’s actual parents or someone known to him or her 2. Contact with the parent figure(s) through some sensory modality (e.g., “I see them nearby”; “I don’t really see them, but I feel that they’re there”; “I hear the mother singing softly to me”) 3. The absence of any overtly harmful frightening behaviors by the parent(s), such as yelling, criticizing, or ignoring

The patient may or may not at this point describe the parent or parents as engaging in specific attachment-promoting ways of being, but as long as there is some sense of their presence and there are no negative ways of being or behaviors reported, the work can proceed.

If the patient indicates that the images are of his or her actual parents, other relatives, or other people who the patient knows or has known, or if the parent figures exhibit harmful ways of being, the therapist provides guidance for letting go of these images and returning to the therapeutic task of creating fictional, ideal parent figures.

It is very important to reinforce focus on the imagined parents’ ways of being rather than on what they are doing. As noted in Chapter 2, positive qualities of being are much more important for attachment security than actions that the parents may take, even beneficial caretaking actions such as providing meals and reading bedtime stories. Such caretaking actions will promote security if they are done in the context of ways of being that communicate some combination of the five behavioral pillars for promoting secure attachment: protection, attunement, soothing, expressed delight, and support for self-development.

The therapist points to the patient’s experience of the mother being interested in her and “marks” the positive experience by emphasizing the feeling, emphasizing that it is hers, and pointing her attention to how she feels it in her body. Because of the primacy of the body for identity and memory during the critical period for attachment formation, anchoring the emerging positive states in the felt experience of the body increases the likelihood that the positive states will be associated with the new attachment representations.

The guiding principle is that although instrumental or caretaking behaviors are not in themselves problematic, they can be done with or without the parental qualities of being that promote attachment security. Whenever these behaviors are present in a patient’s imagery, the therapist acknowledges and validates them and shapes the imagery so that the parent figures show a positive quality of being toward the patient.

This patient’s AAI had revealed her to have anxious-preoccupied attachment (E2). The therapist thus anticipated that in the imagery she would tend toward focusing more on the parent figures’ states and needs than on her own. In her initial report about the imagery, she referred to “something on the wall that’s soft, like fur” and indicated that the parents “like that and they show it to me. Maybe they pat it, and help me to pat it.” While this interaction appears to be a positive one, it is the parents’ preference (“they like that”) and action (“they pat it”) that are primary. The therapist chose to shape the parent figure imagery so that the patient would experience her own preferences as primary: “They wonder what you’ll be interested in, and they like to help you find things that you’ll enjoy.”

By initially not hearing specific qualities named by the therapist, the patient is primed to access his or her unique needs, which will then be projected as qualities into the construction of the imagined parents, making them “ideal” for that particular patient. In this way, the patient’s parent figures have as their foundation the qualities that come from the patient’s deepest knowing of what was most missing during childhood and thus what in the present will best provide for attachment repair.

it is quite common for patients to describe the parent figures engaging in instrumental actions, such as cooking a meal, reading a bedtime story, or playing a game. Even though such actions may be with and for the child in the imagery, it should not be assumed that the actions are done with qualities of being that promote attachment security. Doing “all the right things” for a child can be partially or completely devoid of attunement, soothing, delight, support for exploration, and even some aspects of protection. Many insecurely attached patients had parents who objectively did “all the right things.” When a patient reports that the parent figures are doing something for him or her, the therapist acknowledges that action, mirroring that it’s present, and then either points attention to or suggests positive, attachment-promoting qualities of being from which the figures are engaging in that doing.

This is a dark time, filled with suffering and uncertainty. Like living cells in a larger body, it is natural that we feel the trauma of our world. So, don’t be afraid of the anguish you feel, or the anger or fear, because these responses arise from the depth of your caring and the truth of your interconnectedness with all beings.

In the more challenging moments of modern life, our sense of awareness often becomes constricted and limited. In times of difficulty and stress, we tend to lose perception of the greater field as our awareness clusters tightly within us. We become compactly self-focused by default. As a result, we are less available; we lose access to those resources that allow us to feel with and for others.

Though trauma disrupts the act of relation, conscious attunement can help us create internal and external coherence, consciously regulate the nervous system, process toxic stress, and feel more embodied and more connected with others. Attunement practices are healing tools for dealing with the effects of trauma—whether in people or across communities—and transparent communication is one such practice.

The patient’s memory for “caretaking” revealed that she experienced her mother as instrumentally caretaking, providing food and shelter and transportation, but not in a caring, attuned way. So the positive opposite of that would be “attuned caretaking.”

But some patients may at first have difficulty recognizing the positive opposite qualities in the parent figures, as these qualities were absent from their early experiences. Such difficulty is heightened if there are defenses against feelings of longing for what was missing. But the therapist’s persistent repetition of the positive opposites, interspersed with repetition of the positive parental qualities already named by the patient, will support the appearance and stability of them in the patient’s imagery.

We highly recommend that therapists obtain AAI transcripts and scoring for every patient with relational disturbance. The richness of detail about childhood attachment experience that the AAI elicits is tremendously valuable for introducing and shaping the IPF imagery. In addition, when an AAI is given at the beginning of treatment, it can be given again during a later phase of treatment to assess progress in very specific areas.

When you feel like you cannot do the things in your life that really matter to you, such as finding a job that satisfies you, or creating a loving relationship with a beautiful partner, then it is time to do something about your shyness. When shyness prevents you from living the life that you truly want, then it can be described as social anxiety or social phobia.

Psychological research on infants has found that some people are born with more of what researchers call behavioral inhibition. This means they are less extroverted and tend to be more easily over-stimulated by high levels of interaction. While this inhibition can be seen as a form of shyness, it does not directly lead to social anxiety.

Social anxiety is a complex result of many experiences from your environment growing up—your biology, your family, your early childhood experiences, your experiences in grade school, middle school, high school, etc. These stages of development help us learn more about the world around us, and ourselves. It is during these years that we make conclusions about ourselves, such as people don’t like me, or I am not good enough, which create social anxiety.

We are social creatures. We value love and connection above all else. The idea that we are not going to receive love because of some defect in ourselves can cause a tremendous amount of fear and anxiety. This fear can cause us to be nervous around others. What if they see that there is something wrong with me? This fear causes us to be wary of how we come across, and to be extremely self-conscious while interacting with others. It leads to a need to hide flaws and character defects, for fear of being “found out” and rejected. When we are feeling socially anxious, we essentially feel like we are on a narrow tightrope above a 200 foot drop. The slightest false move will bring on harsh judgment, ridicule and rejection.

People who are shy and anxious start by looking at the other person’s eyes, then they hyper-focus on two primary areas: the innermost portion of the eyebrows and the corners of the mouth. They are searching for lowering of the eyebrows, which is an expression of anger, and curling of the corners of the mouth, which can indicate disdain or disgust. In short, socially anxious people actively search for ways that others might be upset or disapproving of them.

Whether it was a parent frequently yelling at you, or other kids in middle school making fun of you, this message may have been conveyed hundreds of times.

To interact with the world and really test it by asking yourself: Is my certainty that I will get rejected really true? You just might find that your belief is actually not true, that the person actually does not reject you. As you repeat this kind of experiment again and again, you will accumulate a growing body of evidence that shows you that you are indeed worthy of love and belonging. As this evidence grows, it eventually becomes harder and harder to believe in the old story that you are not enough and that you are not lovable.

social anxiety comes from believing on some level that you are not good enough and therefore not worthy of love and belonging. When you believe this, you will feel anxious around others. Believing this will also make you hyper-sensitive to rejection from others, because it confirms that deep fear inside of you.

Almost anything worth having requires taking some measure of risk. Whether it is applying for your top school, approaching a woman you find fascinating, going in for the kiss, putting yourself out there, going for the dream job, or pursuing a career that fills you with passion, you will inevitably encounter rejections along the way. Many rejections.

It is important to note that there is nothing wrong with being nice, friendly, warm, or giving. People who are shy often have these valuable traits and strengths. The key is to realize the difference between genuine warmth and fear-based niceness. The latter is a way to avoid rejection and can limit your fulfillment in relationships.

In addition to fearing that everyone will reject us, our rejection sensor can also exaggerate how others feel about us. If someone says “no, thanks,” or “not right now,” we can feel like they are saying “I hate you. You are pathetic. Go away.” A simple “no” becomes complete revulsion. This sensitive rejection sensor leads to a heightened ability to perceive rejection around you.

When our rejection sensors are set to pick up very subtle cues, we can feel rejected very frequently. You can feel rejected when someone is not interested in what you are saying, when someone has a slight disagreement with an idea of yours, or when someone does not want to hang out now and would prefer to hang out on a different day. Any of these subtle forms of disapproval can feel like a stab in the heart, an intensely uncomfortable or painful experience because they immediately plug into the I’m not enough self-concept.

The more we fear this, the more we worry that other people will realize our true, flawed nature and reject us as well. To compensate, we engage in a quest to make sure that everyone likes us. This can include listening to everyone, being friendly all of the time, doing whatever we think others would prefer, and generally being as accommodating as possible.

Social anxiety can make experiencing any form of rejection so painful that we often end up avoiding anything that even feels like rejection. This often includes arguments, disagreements, and any form of conflict. When we disagree with someone, or someone disagrees with us, it can feel tense, filled with feelings of mutual animosity and disapproval. When you have conflict with someone, you are inherently having some difference of opinions. They are not agreeing with or approving of some opinion, idea, or action of yours. This can feel like a rejection of you as a person, and can be uncomfortable and scary.

The first line of defense against conflict is basic avoidance. • We do not mention things that bother us. • We talk ourselves out of being bothered. • We criticize ourselves in our heads for being “too sensitive.” If this does not work, we may take the second avoidance approach—being overly nice. • We outwardly agree even when we inwardly disagree. • We say whatever we need to in order to please the other person. • We act in a more submissive and compliant manner.

Wait a minute, if this inner critic is trying to stop me from taking risks, then why does it attack me so harshly after I don’t take a risk? It attacks me ruthlessly when I don’t approach a woman. After we have avoided the risk, we are left with the reality that we did not get the girl, did not get the job, and ultimately are not getting the life that we want. This is scary and painful. It also feeds into the old story that we do not have the life we want because there is something wrong with us, because we are not good enough. The critic then tries to protect us from this awful truth by whipping us into shape. This is like the parent who beats his child for failing to get good enough grades. It is the punishment mentality that so many of us grew up with. If you are not doing well enough in something, you need to be criticized and punished until you do better. Even though this is highly ineffective, many of our parents learned this from their parents. Our inner critic continues to use this approach, despite its inefficacy.

It can feel like a constant companion that follows you everywhere you go, berating you ceaselessly for your faults and inadequacies.

First it tells you that you are not good enough, and therefore you will not succeed. This is often convincing enough to make you give up without trying. Why take a chance if it is not going to work out anyways? If, through some level of internal struggle, you muster up the courage to at least make an attempt, it will trip you up while you are trying. It will be in your mind, telling you that you are not doing a good enough job, or that people are bored and dislike you. Then, after you have made an attempt, it will tell you that it was not good enough and that you are a failure, no matter what the real outcome was.

Have you ever experienced this? Have you ever ignored the inner critic, pushed him aside, and mustered up the courage to take the risk anyway? You started the conversation with those people, gave the presentation, or went over to that woman you found compelling and introduced yourself. And best of all, it went well! She smiled and you two had a lovely conversation. What happens next? You might have felt elated for a moment, which is perfectly reasonable and enjoyable. But sooner or later, the critic works its way back in and starts saying: She only talked with you because she was bored. She probably doesn’t really like you. Maybe there’s something wrong with her. Maybe she’s desperate.

Confidence is something you create over time by making small choices each day. This brings you out of the thoughts in your mind and into the world around you as you begin to ask and reflect on the following fundamental questions: • What really happens when I take a risk and go talk with this person? • Is it really true that everyone will reject me? • Is it true that I cannot handle rejection?

People would simply make a decision and shift things on their own. The reality is that beliefs, especially the old entrenched ones, are resilient.

True differentiation is not about being indifferent or uncompassionate. That is being detached and uncaring. Differentiation means you can still care about someone’s feelings. You can even help them, support them, and listen to them. But you realize on a deep level that you are not responsible for fixing all of their feelings, and that you cannot control their feelings as much as you wish and hope you could.

It can be incredibly freeing and relaxing to acknowledge that you will disappoint people in your life, and that they will disappoint you. Disappointment does not mean the end of a relationship. Rather, it is just another emotion that is part of being a human in connection with others.

Repeatedly experiencing this reality can help you start to know on a deep level that you are indeed lovable and worthwhile as you are, even with your human flaws and shortcomings.

Over-accommodation means doing what we think other people will want in order to get them to like us, and to avoid conflict.

Many people who struggle with shyness and social anxiety have a very strong set of values related to kindness, giving, and being supportive of others in their lives. This is a noble way to live, and will often greatly benefit you in your relationships. However, it is also very common for people with social anxiety to have a strong fear of being seen as selfish. They believe that when they look at and prioritize what they want, they’re putting themselves first, which is selfish and wrong.

When we are operating from the belief of shyness—that there is something wrong with us and that we don’t deserve love and belonging—then we naturally assume people will reject us. We assume those around us will immediately reject our wants and desires. If you want to spend time with someone, you will assume that they probably would not want to spend time with you. If you want to sleep with someone, you might automatically conclude that there is no way they would want to sleep with you. With this assumption of rejection, it is easy to conclude that people will find all of our wants and needs to be annoying, weird, or off-putting.

In short, the more you are buying into the fundamental belief of social anxiety, the more you will assume that you, and whatever you want, will be rejected. As a result, you might avoid asking for what you want, or you may wait until you know that it is absolutely safe to ask for what you want because the other person wants it as well. As you will see later in this book, it is absolutely essential that you challenge the assumption that people will reject you, and be put-off by your wants or requests. One basic way to begin challenging that assumption

Rather than being imposing, annoying, or unattractive, knowing what you want and asking for it is actually very compelling for the people in your life. It allows them to know you and to fully see what is going on in your mind and heart. This is what true connection and intimacy are all about—sharing what you are thinking and feeling in the moment.

In order to ask for what you want, you must give yourself full permission to explore this question on a daily basis: “What do I want in this situation?” This exploration is not selfish. Rather, it is an exploration into taking care of yourself. You are discovering how to operate with a healthy level of self-interest. You are curious about who you are, what you want, and what you are feeling. This comes from a place of honoring and valuing whatever it is you are experiencing.

Even if someone does not want what you want, as a differentiated person you can say, “Hmm, he doesn’t want that. That’s OK. I still want that.” If someone does not want the same thing as you, does that mean that what you wanted was wrong? We can have so much shame and judgment around our personal, vulnerable desires, and especially our deeper desires:

Each time you discover what you want and speak it, you are honoring who you are in this moment. The more you do this, the stronger your sense of self will become, which will help you handle rejection and disappointment. You will be able to feel more comfortable in who you are and what you like, do not like, and what you desire.

It can be very uncomfortable to reveal our desires—and ourselves—in this way. Yet every time we avoid doing so, we allow the belief that there is something wrong with us to continue. Every time you do ask for a want, even if it is declined, you are strengthening something inside of yourself. You can experience a no and see that you survive, and that there is nothing wrong with what you wanted.

People with social anxiety often filter out strengths: the things that make you capable, strong, resourceful and competent. These are often ignored, explained away, or in some other way determined not to count. In addition, the filter lets in a whole host of your flaws, shortcomings, weaknesses and anything else that makes you inferior to others. Here is a brief excerpt from a session I did with a client who was operating with this filter. As you read our conversation, see if you can determine how he sees himself:

Did you notice how Karl was easily able to access his shortcomings and flaws, but had a much more difficult time identifying and acknowledging his strengths and his value? There is a reason why Karl, and most people with shyness and social anxiety, undervalue themselves. It is the result of a skewed self-concept.

As you recall, the underlying belief of shyness is I am not good enough and not worthy of love. The main way to overcome this belief is to work extra hard to be likeable, to be good, to be worthwhile. Part of that extra work is to avoid doing anything that might turn people off, including being self-focused and unaccommodating to the requests of others.

If you truly want to break free of a lingering feeling of anxiety and fear around others, you must learn to change how you see yourself and your strengths. In truth, acknowledging and owning your strengths actually makes you less egotistical. When someone brags a lot, talks incessantly about who or how much they know, or otherwise makes a big deal about their abilities, they are usually overcompensating for an underlying feeling of insecurity or inadequacy. This comes from not really acknowledging and owning their strengths.

Imagine two people who are studying the martial art of karate. One is early in the process and has acquired a mid-level belt. The other is a seasoned high-degree black belt who has been training for several decades. If you were to have a conversation with these two people, which one do you think would be more likely to tell you all about the latest moves he or she can pull off? Most likely, it would be the newer student. He would be excited and proud of his accomplishments and eager to tell you all about how much he can do and how much he knows. What about the seasoned veteran who has been doing this for twenty years? Would he eagerly tell you how good he is, how much he knows? Most importantly, which one knows on a deep level that they have mastered the art of karate? Which one knows their strength and owns their value?

Without knowing our value, we consistently feel insecure and inadequate. When someone else demonstrates one of their strengths, we might feel inferior and envious. As much as we try to suppress these feelings, they will usually emerge in biting comments or internal self-attack. However, when you are fully rooted in knowing what makes you valuable, in what you have to offer, then someone else demonstrating their strength is no longer threatening.

When we fully acknowledge and own our own strengths, we simply know on a deep level what we are good at. We can draw a sense of self, pride, identity, and worth from these qualities. The more we truly own these strengths, the less we need to brag, explain, or otherwise try to impress others. We simply know our value.

That is amazing that he can do that much with his body. I want to learn more about that. I wonder if I could get some tips on how to run more myself without getting injured. In this scenario, there is no comparison of your inherent worth as human beings. You are simply acknowledging that this person is highly skilled at running, and that you would like to be better at running.

When you are aware of your strengths, you have access to a greater sense of pride, ability, and accomplishment. You have a clear sense of what makes you valuable, and what you bring to others and to the world. In short, you matter. When we are disconnected from this, we have a weaker sense of ourselves, and we often conclude that we do not matter. Our thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and opinions are not as important as the next person’s. A strong sense of self allows you to interact with others in a less inhibited, less bashful way. You have nothing to apologize for because you are worth just as much as anyone else on the planet. If someone disagrees with you, does not like you, or rejects an offer you make, you are able to take it in stride. You realize that not everyone is going to like you, and that not everyone is going to see your strengths. And that is okay because you know on a deep level that you have a lot to offer and there are many people out there who will see and appreciate that.

Self-Acceptance is such an important part of the solution to social anxiety that it has an entire chapter in this book dedicated to it. When you are able to accept yourself for who you are in this moment, a deep sense of peace and relief can begin to emerge. Knowing your strengths allows you to more clearly acknowledge and accept your weaknesses. Your flaws, shortcomings, setbacks, and failures are no longer evidence of personal inadequacy, but are merely part of being a human being. Your knowledge of your strengths serves as an anchor to keep you grounded in the face of setbacks or mistakes. Yes, I might need to work on this area, or I might be struggling here, but I know that I am also an incredibly bright, capable, clever person who can figure things out. Knowing your strengths keeps you balanced and prevents you from coming to negative and generalized conclusions, such as I’m a bad person, or I’m boring. It allows you to see that you are a complete person with moments of strength and glory, as well as moments of confusion and falling short.

One of the major benefits of owning your strengths is that you start to compare yourself less to other people. Most of the comparisons we make are negative and generally have us on the weaker end. He’s stronger than I am. She’s smarter than I am. He’s better looking than I am. He’s funnier and more outgoing than I am… These comparisons carry a heavy weight, as we are often subconsciously concluding that because this person is funnier than we are, he is a better human being. Next to him, we do not deserve to exist. This type of extreme comparison is born out of discounting your own strengths and value to the world. Once you are able to claim your strengths and internalize them, comparisons take on a very different quality. The human worth element is taken out of the equation and the charge is removed. You are able to simply acknowledge if someone is taller, smarter, faster, better or worse looking. There is no conclusion about their worth as a person. This comes out of the realization that everyone has things they are good at—strengths, abilities, personality traits, etc.—as well as things in which they are lacking. Do not be fooled—that attractive, witty, outgoing person has challenges, flaws, and insecurities just like you do. Everyone does.

Another great way to tap into your strengths is to do the following thought experiment. Imagine someone you really admire. Someone you find absolutely incredible. It could be someone you know personally, someone in your family, a friend, someone you’ve seen in movies, a politician, an artist, author…anyone from any time period. Call that person to mind now, and notice what specifically you admire about them. Do you love their intelligence? Their ability to impact others? Their strength or physical prowess? Their compassion and kindness? Think of at least three traits or abilities you admire in this person.

we admire the people we resonate with most. The traits you identified are either traits you yourself have, but are not acknowledging, or traits you have not yet fully developed.

When we believe we are not good enough, we identify parts of ourselves—thoughts, feelings, behaviors, aspects of our physical appearance, etc.—and judge those parts as unacceptable. We find them unappealing, gross, disgusting, irritating, or otherwise wrong in some way. We then tend to assume that other people think the same way, and that they also see those parts of us as gross and unacceptable. We do what psychologists call projection. This is when we project our own internal ideas and feelings onto others, assuming they are thinking and feeling the same way. I don’t like the way my body looks, therefore you must dislike the way my body looks.

We expect other people will reject us, and so we start to anticipate and see rejections in all of our interactions. In other words, we find what we seek. Our mind starts to look for evidence that people think little of us, judge us, and perceive us as not smart enough, tall enough, attractive enough, etc. We see an ambiguous gesture like a crinkled brow, or a quizzical look, and we immediately conclude that they do not like us, that we are unacceptable.

In this way, we continually find evidence to support the belief that we are not good enough, which further convinces us that others will reject us. When we do not like ourselves, when we are rejecting many parts of ourselves, it can be hard to imagine that others can accept us. When people do seem to like us, we can find all kinds of ways to discount their opinion. We might say “they’re just pretending to be nice because they feel sorry for me.” Then we can withdraw from them, which allows us to maintain the belief that we are unacceptable. This, in turn, keeps our social anxiety alive.

This does not mean murdering your inner critic, eradicating it, or banishing it forever. While this is something we might wish we could do after years of being bullied, unfortunately your critic is here to stay. However, it does not have to be in charge, and it does not have to torment you so much. Your task, which the following sections will help you accomplish, is to learn to work with this part of yourself so that you can heed its warnings and fears while still being free to act how you truly want to act. Essentially, it is learning how to not believe it as much. It might still be there, but it no longer has as much power over you. In other words, the dictator is some old guy on a bench playing chess, rather than the absolute ruler of your internal environment.

In addition to being over-generalized and extreme, your critic’s claims are often based on vague, inconclusive evidence. Like a prosecuting attorney with a weak case, your critic will attempt to convict you using nothing but hearsay and speculation.

Face the facts, your critic says. You are boring and they don’t like you. Quit trying to kid yourself. This is referred to as emotional reasoning, and is a way your critic can overwhelm you. In essence, it occurs when you conclude something is true based solely on a strong feeling that it is true. I am a total loser, because I feel like a total loser. This criticism is difficult to challenge because it is based on some very circular logic. When you notice you are doing this, take a step back and look at what is actually happening in the situation.

Feeling unworthy goes hand in hand with feeling separate from others, separate from life. If we are defective, how can we possibly belong? It’s a vicious cycle: The more deficient we feel, the more separate and vulnerable we feel. Underneath our fear of being flawed is a more primal fear that something is wrong with life, that something bad is going to happen. Our reaction to this fear is to feel blame, even hatred, toward whatever we consider the source of the problem: ourselves, others, life itself. But even when we have directed our aversion outward, deep down we still feel vulnerable.

Our feelings of unworthiness and alienation from others give rise to various forms of suffering. For some, the most glaring expression is addiction. It may be to alcohol, food or drugs. Others feel addicted to a relationship, dependent on a particular person or people in order to feel they are complete and that life is worth living. Some try to feel important through long hours of grueling work—an addiction that our culture often applauds. Some create outer enemies and are always at war with the world.

While all humans feel ashamed of weakness and afraid of rejection, our Western culture is a breeding ground for the kind of shame and self-hatred the Dalai Lama couldn’t comprehend. Because so many of us grew up without a cohesive and nourishing sense of family, neighborhood, community or “tribe,” it is not surprising that we feel like outsiders, on our own and disconnected. We learn early in life that any affiliation—with family and friends, at school or in the workplace—requires proving that we are worthy. We are under pressure to compete with each other, to get ahead, to stand out as intelligent, attractive, capable, powerful, wealthy.

The message of “original sin” is unequivocal: Because of our basically flawed nature, we do not deserve to be happy, loved by others, at ease with life. We are outcasts, and if we are to reenter the garden, we must redeem our sinful selves. We must overcome our flaws by controlling our bodies, controlling our emotions, controlling our natural surroundings, controlling other people. And we must strive tirelessly—working, acquiring, consuming, achieving, e-mailing, overcommitting and rushing—in a never-ending quest to prove ourselves once and for all.

“That little girl in the restaurant was me.” She had never felt real in the eyes of her parents, she went on. Being an only child, she felt as if she was on the planet to be the person her parents wanted her to be. Her value rested solely on how well she represented them, and whether or not she made them proud. She was their object to manage and control, to show off or reprimand. Her opinions and feelings didn’t matter because, as she said, they didn’t see her as “her own person.” Her identity was based on pleasing others and the fear of not being liked if she didn’t. In her experience, she was not a real person who deserved respect and who, without any fabrication or effort, was lovable.

when parents are genuinely present and loving, they offer their child a mirror for his or her goodness. Through this clear mirroring a child develops a sense of security and trust early in life, as well as the capacity for spontaneity and intimacy with others. When my clients examine their wounds, they recognize how, as children, they did not receive the love and understanding they yearned for. Furthermore, they are able to see in their relationships with their own children the ways they too fall short of the ideal—how they can be inattentive, judgmental, angry and self-centered.

Our imperfect parents had imperfect parents of their own. Fears, insecurities and desires get passed along for generations. Parents want to see their offspring make it in ways that are important to them. Or they want their children to be special, which in our competitive culture means more intelligent, accomplished and attractive than other people.

an employee number (natural key) may be changed if the employee resigns and then is rehired. When the data warehouse wants to have a single key for that employee, a new durable key must be created that is persistent and does not change in this situation. This key is sometimes referred to as a durable supernatural key. The best durable keys have a format that is independent of the original business process and thus should be simple integers assigned in sequence beginning with 1.

Sometimes a dimension is defined that has no content except for its primary key. For example, when an invoice has multiple line items, the line item fact rows inherit all the descriptive dimension foreign keys of the invoice, and the invoice is left with no unique content. But the invoice number remains a valid dimension key for fact tables at the line item level. This degenerate dimension is placed in the fact table with the explicit acknowledgment that there is no associated dimension table.

During his all-night vigil, the Buddha looked deeply into his own suffering. His amazing insight was that all suffering or dissatisfaction arises from a mistaken understanding that we are a separate and distinct self. This perception of “selfness” imprisons us in endless rounds of craving and aversion. When our sense of being is confined in this way, we have forgotten the loving awareness that is our essence and that connects us with all of life.

However, if the therapist is not qualified to fully administer the AAI and an AAI transcript is unavailable for a particular patient, an alternative way of obtaining parental relationship information is to explore it in detail during the initial evaluation. As part of history-taking, the therapist asks the patient to describe in a narrative way his or her early relationships with parents or other caregivers and probes to obtain as much detail as possible in order to get a sense of the parents’ typical ways of being with the patient and the typical ways the patient experienced the relationships with the parents. In this way, it is possible to obtain sufficient information for establishing positive-opposite qualities to include in the development of ideal parent figures.

For example, such a patient might say that she felt “sad” and “empty” and “lonely.” Transforming these into positive opposites and applying them to the ideal father figure might yield the following statement during an IPF session: Notice how this father is being with you in ways that bring you feelings of happiness, and fullness. And you don’t ever feel lonely when you’re together with this father.

The therapist holds the larger context of overseeing and guiding the session, and within the context of the imagery frame constructed during that session, he or she responds to what arises in the patient by referencing the parent figures’ responses to what has arisen. For example, in the initial IPF session, a patient expressed fear about seeing the parent figures: Patient: I don’t know; this is kind of scary, seeing them there looking at me. I’m not sure I can do this. Therapist: Yes, and these parents understand how scary this can be for you. Notice how they show you that they understand that, and that they won’t rush you in any way. They find just the right ways to help you to feel safe, with this, and with them. And they help you to see that they won’t let anything bad happen to you, that they’ll do their best to protect you in all circumstances.

Through this interaction, the therapist was accepting of the patient’s experience and pointed toward the possibility of being closer together. He did not suggest any specific ways for that to happen, but instead highlighted that the parents “know that it’s important for you to be closer together, but only in a way that’s safe and is best for you.” How that would happen was left to the frame and the parent figures in the frame: “Let’s see what happens so that you can all be together, safe and sound.” When the shift to being closer together happened, the therapist simply noted that “something has shifted,” then highlighted the immediacy of greater closeness (“you’re already closer together”), and then again indicated trust in the frame to continue the process (“Let’s see what happens next”).

Depth of experience alone is the  yardstick of spirituality and, that too, irrespective of the  sphere ofactivity. One can be intensely spiritual while working  in the Stock- Exchange or in a brothel—or one may be anything  but spiritual in a church or in an Ashram.

Thus the more our inner life has  dried up the more do difficulties in the external world loom  insurmountable. When we are exhausted within we seek  solace from without. What slows down our enthusiasm for  the spiritual life is a lack of profound interest for the Quest.

What is subjectively felt as ‘profound interest’ finds its expression in the objective world as  ‘genuine enthusiasm’. By profound interest we mean an interest  so deep as to cease from being interest for, in or about a specific  thing and becomes an interest-in-itself unrelated to any specific  object. It is this state of interest-in-itself which brings about  ‘genuine enthusiasm’. Interest in a specific object excludes  that open-mindedness essential to heightened sensitivity. Heightened sensitivity and enthusiasm go _ together. Without  heightened sensitivity and enthusiasm even great pleasures  (be they earthly or heavenly) would subjectively be experienced  as dull.

The spiritual path cannot be treaded until it is discovered.  Attempts to tread the spiritual path before having found it give  rise to untold needless difficulties. The result then is weariness,  dejection and frustration because that element of inner joy  (called Priti in Zenoga) is missing. The attempt to imitate a  particular pattern of living taught in spiritual books is not a  discovery ofthe Path butamcreattempt to mould and confine  Life to fit into that pattern.

It requires us to be vulnerable enough to allow ourselves to be seen. It requires curiosity and vision to fully take in who the other person is. To really see them. To accept their on-camera selves, and their hidden behind-the-scenes mess. To view their worst parts with acceptance and generosity, not contempt. And to have enough faith and strength to trust the other person to offer the same latitude to our darker sides.

Some days, when you have a lot on your plate and feel confident, or at least happily preoccupied with life, the stress is manageable. Other days, it can feel like a constant battle against an opponent only you can see. Sometimes the pain of being single hits you on the best days of all, when you’re carried away with a peak experience, and it’s exactly the exceptional quality of this happiness that reminds you that you have no one to share it with, no one to listen to you when you’re doing something that excites you, no one beside you if you just want to take it all in in silence.

These calculations help with the difficulties of being single too: There’s a way to cultivate a curiosity about experiences that are a few degrees different from the ones we usually have. It’s like that moment waking up: The longer I could stay curious, the longer it took for the pain to settle back in.

Could the person we once happened to have an amazing connection with actually be the right person for us for life? If that actually were the case, MDMA would be the most valuable substance around because of the overwhelming feeling of love it can produce for a few short hours. But that’s an experience and not a relationship, which is, by definition, ongoing. You don’t find the pattern for a relationship worth having in a brief connection that produces a burst of peak sensation and then disappears. It would be absurd to wake up the next day and tell your friends that your MDMA buddy is your destiny. But too often that’s the love story we want to tell.

Just like a comedian who gets nervous because now she’s in front of a live audience and wants the audience to like her and the stakes feel really high, we forget our playful, relaxed, authentic selves when we are face-to-face with someone we like. The mere fact that we like them makes it feel as if the stakes are really high. As we will find out, there’s nothing high at all about the stakes at this stage. In fact, level 1—admiration—isn’t really important at all. It is nothing more than a mind trick.

The older we get, the easier it becomes to feel less visible to the world, as if our moment onstage has passed. To add to that, our standards tend to be higher, or at the very least more particular; many of us find ourselves attracted to fewer people as we become clearer on what we are looking for. So when we meet someone we like, and that person returns the attraction, it feels both rare and valuable.

Having mutual attraction (Importance Level 2, above) is equivalent to two people discovering a plot of land together that seems to have potential. Maybe it’s on a hillside, or by a lake, or in a prime spot in the city. It’s a great, picturesque plot of land. But nothing is built there yet. What it needs to realize its potential is two builders, two people who both say, “Yes, let’s build a beautiful castle of our own here.”

Think about it for a moment. If there’s someone in your life you have mutual attraction with (level 2), who also commits to you (level 3), and they suddenly get hit by a bus, that’s tragic. No one would blame you for grieving in a situation like that. But now imagine (you might not have to) that you are going through the same emotions over the loss of someone who told you they didn’t want to commit to you. That person didn’t die; they’re still walking around, or sitting at home ordering ridiculous things on Amazon. They’re just choosing not to be with you. How important to your love life can they possibly be?

That’s what it’s like in the early stages of attraction just when we decide we like someone. There’s a temptation to just surrender to the feeling, clear our schedule, and see if they’re game to fly to Paris together or begin inquiring as to whether our company has offices in a town near them that wasn’t even on our radar a month ago. In our excitement over a person we’ve only been on one or two dates with, we get ahead of ourselves. We give in to our romantic instincts and rocket into a realm of fantasy romance.

it’s good to keep in mind the easily recognizable qualities that do make a good partner: They’re kind and compassionate. They show up for you, consistently, reliably. They communicate well. They’re honest and trustworthy. They make a great teammate. They care about your day and the challenges you face, and they want to support you as you face them. (And if those sound like qualities that make you head for the hills, you’re not looking for a relationship!)

The only person worth having in our love story is the one who values what we have to give. Part two of that rule is that they won’t value what we have to give if we don’t put a high price on it ourselves. If they get the idea that we’ll fight for them even when they’re pulling away, first they’re going to think we’re way too intense, then they’re going to wonder what this one-sided intensity says about us, our confidence in ourselves, and who we are.

Date One is just about having fun, and, on our side, being great company. On a first date, we want to see if they’re great company, but we want to be great company too. After Date One, we want to maintain a nice balance to make sure we’re being present. It’s a kind of mindful dating: If it’s Date Three, be on Date Three. Don’t skip ahead to Date Fifty-Six. Let yourself enjoy every stage. Slow down.

mothers were asked to climb a series of steps in a way that their infants could not follow after them. Both secure and insecure infants showed a distress response. The main difference was that securely attached infants looked longer when the mother kept going, but the insecurely attached infants were more “surprised” when the mother came back. Thus infants with secure and insecure attachment relationships had formed different expectations about whether a caretaker would return and help the child in need.

Teyber and McClure define psychotherapy as a “collaborative partnership”: One of the most important ways for therapists to establish a strong working alliance with clients is to work together collaboratively—as partners. In the initial session, the therapist’s primary aim is to articulate clear expectations for working in this collaborative manner, and, more important, to enact behaviorally these spoken expectations by giving clients the experience of partnership . . . Thinking of the working alliance as a collaborative partnership, therapy is not something therapists “do” to clients, it is a shared interaction that requires the participation of both parties in order to succeed.

However, the process also requires that the therapist share his or her own impressions, based on the interview of the patient, about the goals and best approach to treatment. A mutually negotiated treatment plan (Burt, 1979) requires that both patient and therapist share relevant expectations and information toward this common goal.

The more detailed the treatment frame contract, and therefore the more detailed the role expectations, the less the likelihood of misunderstandings and treatment ruptures. Since patients with attachment disturbance have impaired collaborativeness, it is especially important to clearly articulate role expectations and to help them experience and learn to maintain a relationship based on mutual expectations and clear role definitions.

Life is rarely so simple and the choices are not always stark. I wasn’t ready for a serious commitment when I met my wife. Then I changed.

Putting our fear of scaring someone off over our need to know whether that person can actually live up to our standards is a recipe for unhappiness. We need to reverse that equation: My greatest fear should be wasting my life on someone who won’t make me happy, not scaring someone away. Even the person we think is right for us is wrong for us if they’re not invested in our happiness.

“It’s unacceptable to me and I want to talk about why that happened, because I want to understand what led you there so we can make sure it never happens again.” “It’s unacceptable to me” is where you clearly state your boundary. “I want to talk about why that happened, because I want to understand what led you there” is a moment of compassion. It shows a desire to get behind why they did what they did, which is also an opportunity for you to find out whether this person is able to be introspective, self-aware, and appropriately self-critical. “So we can make sure it never happens again” actually demonstrates a spirit of teamwork in solving the problem. If we are doing this (that is, having a relationship), then we need to ensure this never happens again, because it’s beneath the culture of the relationship we both seem ready to commit to.

“Well, I noticed that he had a chin dimple, so I said: ‘I like your chin dimple. It’s not quite as cute as my daughter’s cheek dimples, but I like it!’” The audience laughed and instinctively picked up on the kind of fun, attractive energy that the guy must have felt the night before when she said that to him. Here was a perfect example of how a hard conversation never came to be for one person, but remained a hard conversation for another. The first woman talked as though she had Darth Vader waiting at home for any guy who got close to her. The second woman managed to talk about her daughter in the same breath as she used to flirt with someone.

Immensely charismatic people who know how to charm and excite you are giving you a great date. Players love giving the best dates, not because they’re into you, but because their ego thrives on you being so into them. They enjoy seducing, and what they want to hear is: “That was the best date I’ve ever had!” You might actually say that only to have them think, “Fantastic! More women must experience these phenomenal dates.”

Carl Rogers once said, “The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.” He was echoing Lao-tzu, who some 2,600 years earlier wrote in more poetic terms: “If you want to shrink something, you must first allow it to expand. If you want to get rid of something, you must first allow it to flourish. If you want to take something, you must first allow it to be given. This is called the subtle perception of the way things are.”

Studies have shown that 70–80% of communication occurs through mostly unconscious somatic signals—pace, posture, gestures, voice quality, breathing patterns, changes in energy, and skin coloration. These signals arise directly from the core beliefs and models of the world that the client holds. By not allowing ourselves to be carried away with the content of a client’s story, we can begin to notice the many other ways in which a client communicates.

This innate drive continuously influences how we engage in relationships, build communities, and find meaning in our lives. We are most inspired toward our best self when we feel grounded and experience a deep sense of security inside ourselves and in the relationships around us. In fact, when we feel secure, we are compassionate, flexible, benevolent, and connected to the well-being of the collective—whether that’s the “we” in our primary relationships or the “we” in humanity.

Secure Relating is about stabilizing and protecting your most evolved and grounded sense of self, especially when we are being incited to regress to the most primitive parts of our nature. In the chapters ahead, you’ll learn to build and sustain a competence fueled by security that will benefit everyone: you of course, but also your kids, romantic partner(s), friends, family, colleagues and your community. You’ll discover strategies to help you better co-regulate (instead of co-dysregulate), communicate more effectively, and even respond to conflict with a modicum of grace.

When we are unconsciously defensively activated, we lose access to discernment and nuance and are prone to jump into action, a quirk that gets intentionally used against us. It’s a familiar strategy in politics—igniting fear and mistrust surpasses evoking hope and inspiration in its effectiveness to galvanize us to pick sides, rally, and show up to vote. Marketers and media outlets also strategically employ the concept of scarcity and our own insecurity to seize our attention, move us to act, and thus bolster their financial gains.

Imagine with us for a moment: You’re sitting on your couch engrossed in your screen when a slight movement on the wall to your right catches your attention. Your gaze instinctively shifts and falls on something you’ve never seen before—a strange, rather elegant insect. Its unusual shape captivates you, so you lean in closer for a better look. Its long, graceful antennae extend from its head and remind you of a butterfly, but its iridescent shell is more beetle-like, glistening with an array of captivating colors. You are mesmerized by this otherworldly creature and are struck that you’ve not encountered anything like it before. Then you remember your cat, who loves to stalk and capture bugs, so you consider catching this little guy to take it outside to protect it.

here are a few characteristics that describe when you are in that well-rounded, balanced secure state of mind: Emotional Regulation: You are less likely to lose your mind when stressed and can generally express feelings and needs without being overwhelmed by intense emotions in yourself or others. Autonomy: You can usually be close and connected to others without feeling trapped, and you are generally comfortable on your own.

Secure relating includes recognizing that you’re feeling defensive, dealing with your own activation, and making room for others even when it is challenging. In this case, it would look like catching yourself before butting in to add your perspective–a master move! It might involve clarifying that you will share your perspective afterward so you can settle into listening, or recognizing you can’t listen right now and asking for some time to settle down before continuing the conversation. It’s flexible and imperfect, which is wonderful.

Being in the green means we can tap into what is happening inside us and be interested in what’s happening to the other person simultaneously. This is relating securely—we don’t have to drop ourselves to connect with the (perceived) wants of others, nor do we cut off or forget about the other person. Instead, we simultaneously hold a connection to them and ourselves. Being able to feel feelings for the person across from us and for ourselves is a great green zone description.

Tracking your level of activation is the same thing as caring about your sense of safety. Noticing when and why you uptick will help you recognize your blooming pinkish activation more quickly and help you make choices about what to do about it. These insights propel conscious shifts in states and, if practiced, eventually can become naturally occuring traits of our rich, untidy personalities.

Blue Zone Activation We can also have well-worn strategies aimed at deactivating, or cutting off, our emotions. This is represented by the color blue, as we sometimes become a bit cooler, even cold. As defensive deactivation intensifies, this is represented by the colors turning from green and darkening as we slide left down the spectrum toward dark blue. This blue-tilted progression represents withdrawal into oneself, emotional disengagement, and a heavier reliance on thinking over feeling.

Blue zone activation generally reduces expressiveness and moves us away from feelings, also called down-regulation, and the primary goal is to avoid vulnerability. Shifting toward the blue side means that you are (mostly unconsciously) motivated to avoid emotions and to pull more inside yourself at that moment. Seeking emotional distance does not make you mean or withholding, it’s simply been encoded in your mind and body that avoiding emotion and vulnerability is the right way to stay safe.

Most often it’s a pretty clear move toward avoidance, but the blue zone isn’t limited to withdrawal. It may also look like an uptick in anger to stop an interaction (versus anger to engage more actively over on the other side of the spectrum), quick dismissal of the topic, or moving into action via hyperrationality. Notice they all have the underlying intent of shutting down someone else’s emotional expression or our own so that we can become more comfortable again.

If we do not realize that we have shut down, we are likely to remain in a deactivated state for long periods of time to avoid potential conflict. Simply recognizing that you are traveling down the blue spectrum can be an important step for blue leaners in their journey toward secure relating. You don’t have to be able to change this yet; noticing is a great first step.

By identifying where you are in any given moment—either by noticing if you tend to activate or deactivate, tracking color variations over time, or just noticing small shifts to the right or left—you are already building secure relating capacity! You don’t need to know more about your overall attachment patterns or your unconscious narratives. By just recognizing your state in the moment and focusing on moving toward green, you can immediately impact your relatability in the moment, which is good for everyone involved.

The real problems arise when we feel justified and righteous, unaware that we are defensively activated or uncaring about the impact on those close to us. It’s when we refuse to be aware and vulnerable. Rather than justifying that dismissive eye roll or snarky comment based on someone else’s behavior, stop and ask yourself, What am I feeling? Look for a nonintellectual word, or at most a short phrase—not a paragraph explanation or intellectual description. Feelings sound simple, like mad, sad, or glad, but as you get more discerning, you’ll recognize many more feeling flavors, such as relaxed, content, disheartened, discouraged, sullen, troubled, restless, lively, mellow, and so on. If you tend to struggle recognizing and naming your feelings, don’t hesitate to use a feelings chart or an app to help you.

once you get that down we encourage you to go further than merely noticing you have a feeling. Get curious about what triggered the response inside you beyond what the other person just did. Instead of “I’m mad because she keeps making a big deal about small things,” ask yourself: Why does hearing about small things bother me so much? What feelings does it stir and why?

In our expansion of adult attachment theory, we show that the theory is useful not only to explain connections with close dyadic relationship partners (e.g., parents, close friends, romantic partners/spouses), whom Ainsworth (1991) and others called principal or primary attachment figures, but also human behavior in a much wider variety of relational and social contexts.

For example, I think of a young man for whom all sexual activity was linked with guilt and sin. The problem manifested itself in his inability to reach orgasm during sexual intercourse and led him to avoid every possible form of intimate relationship. It was clear that his problem derived from his ambivalent bond to an extremely prudish mother. What brought him to psychotherapy, however, was the embarrassing symptom of blushing. Every time his fellow students began to speak about topics of a sexual nature, he was overcome with the fear of blushing. The analysis showed that this blushing concealed two contradictory, tormenting ideas. First, he was afraid that everyone he talked to would suspect he had a one-track mind occupied exclusively with sex, when actually, he was uncomfortable with the topic and inwardly disapproved of it the way his mother had. At the same time, he was afraid that his lack of masculine sexual prowess might be discovered.

The following conflict was embodied in his symptom: according to his strict, religious mother, sexual acts and fantasies were sinful. If he violated her holy rule prohibiting sex, he sinned. If he obeyed her rule, he not onlyrepressed a portion of his instinctual energy, he also subjected himself to the shame of being less of a man than those around him.

“guilt-shame dilemma” (1988:288) in which one feels guilty for separating from one’s parents and their partially internalized commandments—even though such a separation is crucial for the development of one’s personality. In contrast to feelings we traditionally associate with the quest for autonomy and separation, one very often feels impotent, servile and exposed. These feelings of inferiority, of being unprepared for life, make one ashamed not only in front of others, but also before oneself. Wurmser saw guilt and shame as antithetical. Guilt is a response to strength and power, shame a response to weakness and impotence. So in the example above, the man who suffered from fits of blushing was plagued by guilt whenever he began to feel inwardly strong and autonomous, whenever he began to disregard his mother’s commandments. When such guilt feelings threatened the stability of his ego, he felt impotent once again and ashamed of his weakness.

Your boyfriend is being rude, and you think he’s acting like a jerk. Maybe your reaction is spot-on and he’s being selfish or uncaring, but what volume are you experiencing your feelings? Not everyone would have the same volume and accompanying internal chatter about it. So, how do you know what is true? This is where gaining awareness of your internal stories and how your body tends to protect itself really comes in. We aren’t saying don’t trust yourself and instead question all your feelings—it’s quite the opposite. Learn to know and trust yourself so much that you recognize what parts of you to listen to and when, and what parts may be whispering in your ear and steering you wrong.

The good news about authenticity is that it doesn’t require you to be right, accurate, or fair. Finding your authentic feelings starts with reflection and curiosity. This reflection can be explored together. For instance, why do you feel anxious every time she goes out with friends? Rather than jumping to fix the problem and eradicate the uncomfortable feeling, take some time to first explore what emerges for you.

When we’re stirred up, we tend to blame the bug (or, more specifically, the person “out there” causing our uncomfortable feelings or keeping us stuck in overwhelm). We focus on the bug and then try to make sense of our experience—this could range anywhere from warm, pleasant feelings (What a sweet creature) to aversive feelings of disgust (Invading insect!). The bug didn’t do anything wrong; it was being a bug. Our feelings toward it changed when threat and fear were introduced, which led to the deliberate bug murder. It’s uncomfortable to look just at our side of things: we want to explain ourselves based on the bug’s behavior, but in fact we killed it because we had an uncomfortable feeling. Since the most important action is happening inside us, we must learn how to direct our attention inward rather than focusing on others as the cause of or the cure for relating securely.

From the get-go, we each learn whether or not to expect people to be there for us, how they’ll show up, how to avoid rejection, how to disarm hostility, and how to get our needs met through our specific caregivers, with our specific temperament, in our specific family, neighborhood, community, and culture. And all of this is embedded in deep personal history that matters now. No one escapes this truth, whether you are aware of these factors impacting you now or not, because it all begins before we know we are learning.

However, when he’s just fussy and she can’t fix it, Mama gets impatient, and he can feel it. She knows what to do when he needs something concrete, such as feeding, changing his diaper, and keeping him warm, but she gets flustered when his needs are less concrete, emotionally driven, and not easily resolved. Over time, Mama becomes more stern, and eventually Derek learns that it is not helpful to cry unless there is “good reason.” When Derek’s content, Mama is right there, but when he’s whining, she communicates subtle disapproval, scowling or turning away if he becomes too needy or tries to crawl up in her lap.

Like Derek, as we adapt to our early environment, we internalize many life lessons. Up to this moment, you, the reader, have accumulated a lifetime of experiences that have created an internal template of what you expect from the world and how you view yourself and others. These experiences have literally shaped how your mind develops; what brings you comfort or anxiety; what you tend to focus on or ignore; your underlying assumptions, values, and beliefs; and the deep knowing of what your body deems safe or threatening. No two templates are alike—it’s part of what makes you uniquely you. This is your attachment system in 3-D.
